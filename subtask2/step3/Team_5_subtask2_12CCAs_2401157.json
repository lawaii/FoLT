A multi-component provider intervention, including an education session, repeated contacts, individualized feedback, and incentives, probably improves the uptake of HPV vaccine compared to usual practice. Additionally, class-based school vaccination strategies and recipient-oriented interventions, such as education, reminders, incentives, and mandatory vaccination, have been proposed to enhance vaccination uptake among adolescents. Further research is needed to enhance adolescent vaccination uptake[1][3].","llm_answer_ref":"Citations:\n[1] https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/31978259\/\n[2] https:\/\/www.cochranelibrary.com\/cdsr\/doi\/10.1002\/14651858.CD011895.pub2\/full\n[3] https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6984618\/\n[4] https:\/\/publications.aap.org\/pediatrics\/article\/149\/Supplement%206\/e2021053852D\/186948\/Interventions-to-Improve-Immunization-Coverage\n[5] https:\/\/jech.bmj.com\/content\/71\/1\/87","llm_model_name":"PerplexityAI_prompt0_answer","llm_model_prompt":"Provide a concise answer for the following question: Which interventions improve vaccination uptake among adolescents?","topic1":["child health","infectious disease","lungs airways"],"topic2":["respiratory infections"],"year":2021,"author":"Bhat, Smitha"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-11-30T20:30:11.054245Z","updated_at":"2023-12-01T14:06:41.982056Z","inner_id":30,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":1,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":12,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":181,"annotations":[{"id":160,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Valid"]},"id":"10-1002_cca-1143_ChatGPT_prompt0_answer","from_name":"llm_answer_label_1","to_name":"llm_answer_eval_1","type":"choices","origin":"prediction"},{"value":{"start":0,"end":116,"text":"Different support surfaces, like mattresses and cushions, vary in their effectiveness for pressure ulcer prevention.","labels":["General comment"]},"id":"10-1002_cca-1143_ChatGPT_prompt0_answer_sent0","from_name":"llm_answer_fine_grain_label","to_name":"llm_answer_eval_2","type":"labels","origin":"prediction-changed"},{"value":{"start":117,"end":288,"text":"Specialized pressure-relieving surfaces, such as alternating pressure mattresses or low-air-loss beds, tend to be more effective than standard mattresses or foam overlays.","labels":["Agree with the gold answer"]},"id":"10-1002_cca-1143_ChatGPT_prompt0_answer_sent1","from_name":"llm_answer_fine_grain_label","to_name":"llm_answer_eval_2","type":"labels","origin":"prediction-changed"},{"value":{"start":289,"end":384,"text":"The choice should be based on individual patient needs, risk assessment, and clinical judgment.","labels":["General comment"]},"id":"10-1002_cca-1143_ChatGPT_prompt0_answer_sent2","from_name":"llm_answer_fine_grain_label","to_name":"llm_answer_eval_2","type":"labels","origin":"prediction-changed"},{"value":{"start":385,"end":510,"text":"Consulting a healthcare provider is crucial for selecting the most appropriate support surface for pressure ulcer prevention.","labels":["General comment"]},"id":"10-1002_cca-1143_ChatGPT_prompt0_answer_sent3","from_name":"llm_answer_fine_grain_label","to_name":"llm_answer_eval_2","type":"labels","origin":"prediction-changed"},{"value":{"choices":["5.

The analyses comparing specialist supports with each other were often based on small numbers of participants from studies with unclear or poor methodology so conclusions could not be drawn. Compared with standard foam supports, overlays and mattresses, constant low‐pressure (CLP), alternating pressure (AP), or specialist supports, overlays and mattresses generally reduce the incidence of pressure ulcers in older adults in acute care settings, on general, orthopedic or rehabilitation wards, or in specialist units. Low air loss mattresses\/beds also seemed to reduce the incidence of pressure sores compared with standard static mattress or intensive care unit (ICU) beds in adults in acute or long‐term care settings. Jay gel cushions were also beneficial in older adults in extended care facilities\/nursing homes compared with standard foam cushions. When CLP and AP supports, overlays and mattresses were compared with each other (CLP versus CLP, AP versus AP, CLP versus AP), or when CLP and AP mattresses were compared with standard mattresses in patients during and after a stay in ICU, there were no apparent differences in pressure ulcer incidence between groups. A large number of the analyses comparing different non‐standard overlays and mattresses with each other were underpowered (often single trials with fewer than 100 patients), making it difficult either to detect differences between groups, or to have confidence in the results where differences between groups were detected. In addition, most of the studies at an unclear or high risk of bias in terms of participant selection and blinding of outcome assessors, further limiting confidence in the evidence.","gold_answer_terms":"TERM (term): Between 37 and 42 weeks of pregnancy.\nACUTE (acute): new, recent, sudden, urgent\nORTHOPEDIC (orthopedic): pertaining to the bones\nRISK (risk): The chance that an activity or hazard will give rise to harm.
