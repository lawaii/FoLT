Blood CRP, ESR, and WBC have been reported to have higher sensitivity and specificity for discriminating acute pyelonephritis among children with febrile urinary tract infection than urine culture.

Very low‐certainty evidence from the USA suggests that financial incentives in addition to health education may result in better uptake of hepatitis B vaccination than usual care (623 vs 451 per 1000 adolescents); however, the analysis was underpowered, so differences between groups did not reach statistical significance. Moderate‐certainty evidence from the USA shows that a policy for mandatory vaccination resulted in better uptake of hepatitis B vaccination (728 vs 186 per 1000 adolescents). In schools In Tanzania, making the mandatory vaccination class‐based rather than age‐based resulted in better HPV vaccine uptake (787 vs 721 per 1000 adolescents). A single RCT assessing provider prompts compared with usual care could not draw conclusions, as key outcomes were not assessed. Low‐certainty evidence suggests that HPV vaccine uptake was higher with multi‐component provider and parent interventions when compared with usual care, but differences between groups did not reach statistical significance and the analysis was underpowered, so no conclusions can be drawn. No RCTs assessed effects of interventions on vaccine‐preventable diseases or on vaccine‐related adverse events.","url":"https:\/\/www.cochranelibrary.com\/cca\/doi\/10.1002\/cca.2985","llm_answer":"placeholder, please get the answer through the chatbot","llm_answer_ref":"","llm_model_name":"PerplexityAI_prompt0_answer","llm_model_prompt":"Provide a concise answer for the following question: Which interventions improve vaccination uptake among adolescents?","topic1":["child health","infectious disease","lungs airways"],"topic2":["respiratory infections"],"year":2021,"author":"Bhat, Smitha"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-11-30T17:34:01.414991Z","updated_at":"2023-11-30T19:13:11.015314Z","inner_id":30,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":11,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]}]
