High\u2010certainty evidence from the USA and from Sweden shows that uptake of HPV vaccination among adolescents is higher with health education than with usual practice such as health promotion media presentations (363 vs 254 per 1000 adolescents; all results on average). However, participants who received complex health education (in the form of a four\u2010lesson multi\u2010component intervention) had slightly lower rates of hepatitis B vaccine uptake compared with those who received standard government information brochures (738 vs 756 per 1000 adolescents; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Low\u2010certainty evidence from the United Kingdom suggests that financial incentives given to participants on completion of the HPV vaccine course resulted in better vaccine uptake than invitations provided with information leaflets (284 vs 196 per 1000 adolescents). Very low\u2010certainty evidence from the USA suggests that financial incentives in addition to health education may result in better uptake of hepatitis B vaccination than usual care (623 vs 451 per 1000 adolescents); however, the analysis was underpowered, so differences between groups did not reach statistical significance. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence from the USA shows that a policy for mandatory vaccination resulted in better uptake of hepatitis B vaccination (728 vs 186 per 1000 adolescents). In schools In Tanzania, making the mandatory vaccination class\u2010based rather than age\u2010based resulted in better HPV vaccine uptake (787 vs 721 per 1000 adolescents).

Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that HPV vaccine uptake was higher with multi\u2010component provider and parent interventions when compared with usual care, but differences between groups did not reach statistical significance and the analysis was underpowered, so no conclusions can be drawn.
