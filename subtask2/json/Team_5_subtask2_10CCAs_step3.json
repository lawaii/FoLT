            "gold_answer": "Reviewers found that for adults with cardiovascular disease, glucagon‐like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1RA) and sodium‐glucose co‐transporter‐2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) reduced cardiovascular mortality (on average, 5 and 14 people difference per 1000 people, respectively) and all‐cause mortality (8 and 17 people difference per 1000 people) when compared with placebo (high‐certainty evidence for GLP‐1RA and moderate‐certainty evidence for SGLT2i). Although results did not reach statistical significance, GLP‐1RA may have reduced incidence of myocardial infarction (MI; 58 vs 65 per 1000 people) and stroke (26 vs 29 per 1000 people; moderate‐certainty evidence). SGLT2i reduced hospitalization for heart failure (78 vs 116 per 1000 people; high‐certainty evidence). As for adverse effects, moderate‐certainty evidence suggests that DPP4i increased risk of pancreatitis (5 vs 3 per 1000 people), but there was little to no difference between active treatment and placebo for any other adverse effect (worsening of renal function, hypoglycemia or fracture). Results of a network meta‐analysis (NMA) show that GLP1‐RA was ranked the most effective in terms of stroke and MI (high‐ to moderate‐certainty evidence), and SGLT2i the most effective in terms of mortality (moderate‐certainty evidence) and hospitalization for heart failure (high‐certainty evidence). SGLT2i was also ranked the safest treatment in terms of pancreatitis (moderate‐certainty evidence; event rates were very low in all groups) and worsening of renal function (low‐certainty evidence).",

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers found that for adults with cardiovascular disease, glucagon‐like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1RA) and sodium‐glucose co‐transporter‐2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) reduced cardiovascular mortality (on average, 5 and 14 people difference per 1000 people, respectively) and all‐cause mortality (8 and 17 people difference per 1000 people) when compared with placebo (high‐certainty evidence for GLP‐1RA and moderate‐certainty evidence for SGLT2i). Although results did not reach statistical significance, GLP‐1RA may have reduced incidence of myocardial infarction (MI; 58 vs 65 per 1000 people) and stroke (26 vs 29 per 1000 people; moderate‐certainty evidence). SGLT2i reduced hospitalization for heart failure (78 vs 116 per 1000 people; high‐certainty evidence). As for adverse effects, moderate‐certainty evidence suggests that DPP4i increased risk of pancreatitis (5 vs 3 per 1000 people), but there was little to no difference between active treatment and placebo for any other adverse effect (worsening of renal function, hypoglycemia or fracture). Results of a network meta‐analysis (NMA) show that GLP1‐RA was ranked the most effective in terms of stroke and MI (high‐ to moderate‐certainty evidence), and SGLT2i the most effective in terms of mortality (moderate‐certainty evidence) and hospitalization for heart failure (high‐certainty evidence). SGLT2i was also ranked the safest treatment in terms of pancreatitis (moderate‐certainty evidence; event rates were very low in all groups) and worsening of renal function (low‐certainty evidence).",

A study published in JAMA Network Open also found that GLP-1RA was associated with lower all-cause mortality compared to DPP-4 inhibitors. Another study concluded that GLP-1RA and SGLT-2i reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events to a similar degree in patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

Reviewers evaluated the accuracy of different indices that combine menopausal status, USS, and biomarkers in pre‐ and postmenopausal women with symptoms suspicious of OC using histology in those who had undergone surgery, or clinical follow‐up in those with negative index test results, as the reference standard.

This superiority holds regardless of the type of trauma, the operator of the CUS, or the type of CUS probe used [1][2]. The overall sensitivity of CUS is higher than that of supine CXR, while their specificities are similar [1][2]. \nIn a theoretical scenario where CUS was used on a group of 100 patients where 30 (30%) have traumatic pneumothorax, then an estimated 28 would have a CUS result positive for pneumothorax and of these one (3.6%) would be incorrectly classified as having the pneumothorax (false positive); of the 72 patients with a result negative for pneumothorax, three (4.2%) would actually have a pneumothorax (false negative) [3].\nOn the other hand, if CXR was used on the same group of 100 patients, then an estimated 14 would have a CXR result positive for pneumothorax and of these none (0%) would be incorrectly classified as having the pneumothorax (false positive); of the 86 patients with a result negative for pneumothorax, 16 (18.6%) would actually have a pneumothorax (false negative) [3].\nTherefore, CUS is a more accurate diagnostic tool for pneumothorax in trauma patients in the emergency department compared to supine CXR [1][2][3][4].",

However, NPWT had little to no effect on rates of mortality, dehiscence, reoperation, and readmission (low‐ to moderate‐certainty evidence).

According to a study, NPWT significantly reduces drainage amount, increases skin perfusion, and increases tensile strength of the wound. It also has the tendency to promote collagen formation and reduce the risk of wound dehiscence, leading to improved wound healing and reduced risk of surgical site infections (SSIs) compared to standard dressings. NPWT creates a sealed environment, preventing or reducing bacterial entry to the wound, while removing blood and exudate from the wound, which contributes to its positive effects on wound healing. However, NPWT may increase the number of people with skin blistering after surgery, and the cost-effectiveness of NPWT depends on the type of surgery[1][2][4][5].",

Evidence for specificity is of low certainty and is estimated at 94%. Using these pooled estimates and a TB prevalence of 5%, reviewers reported that 57 children could be wrongly diagnosed with pulmonary TB and 19 cases of pulmonary TB could be missed for every 1000 children tested. Children with a missed diagnosis due to a false‐negative test are at high risk of TB‐associated complications. From a pretest probability of 5%, the probability of pulmonary TB would increase to ~35% after a positive test and would decrease to ~2% after a negative test. It is worth noting that one study conducted in South Africa in people up to 20 years of age (median 11 years) contributed 99% of the screens included in the analysis.",

Evidence for specificity is of low certainty and is estimated at 94%. Using these pooled estimates and a TB prevalence of 5%, reviewers reported that 57 children could be wrongly diagnosed with pulmonary TB and 19 cases of pulmonary TB could be missed for every 1000 children tested. Children with a missed diagnosis due to a false‐negative test are at high risk of TB‐associated complications. From a pretest probability of 5%, the probability of pulmonary TB would increase to ~35% after a positive test and would decrease to ~2% after a negative test. It is worth noting that one study conducted in South Africa in people up to 20 years of age (median 11 years) contributed 99% of the screens included in the analysis.",

The benefits and harms of this treatment are as follows:\n**Benefits**:\n1. Thrombolysis effectively dissolves the clot, leading to complete clot breakdown more often than with standard anticoagulant therapy [3].\n2. It reduces post-thrombotic syndrome [5], which includes symptoms like leg pain, swelling, skin pigmentation, and leg ulcers [3].\n3. It provides immediate symptom relief, prevents clinical deterioration and short-term mortality, and prevents long-term complications such as chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension [6].\n**Harms**:\n1. Thrombolysis increases the risk of major bleeding [5].\n2. It has no effect on the risk of death, risk of a blood clot traveling to the lungs or brain (which can cause a stroke), or the risk of bleeding inside the skull [1].\nPlease note that patient factors such as the duration and location of the clot are key to achieving a successful balance of risk and benefit [4]. It's important to discuss these factors with a healthcare provider when considering thrombolysis for DVT.",

However, it is associated with a small increased risk of bleeding. The potential benefits of thrombolysis include immediate symptom relief, prevention of clinical deterioration, and prevention of long-term complications such as chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension and PTS. Thrombolysis also improves the chance of successful clot breakdown and may prevent longer-term complications such as PTS. However, bleeding is a potential harm associated with thrombolysis, and the specific drug, dose, or method of administration used makes no difference to the rate of this adverse effect[1][2][4].",

According to a Cochrane review, the ESR test does not appear to be sufficiently accurate to differentiate children with cystitis from those with pyelonephritis. A low CRP value (<20 mg/L) appears to be somewhat useful in ruling out pyelonephritis, but there is unexplained heterogeneity in the data. The summary specificity values for procalcitonin, CRP, and ESR tests at certain cutoffs were 0.74, 0.39, and 0.48, respectively. Blood CRP, ESR, and WBC have been reported to have higher sensitivity and specificity for discriminating acute pyelonephritis among children with febrile urinary tract infection than urine culture. Therefore, while these biomarkers may have some utility, their accuracy for the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis in children is not definitive and may vary depending on the specific context and cutoff values used[1][2].",

            "gold_answer": "For high‐risk adults (most individuals with HIV, miners, or prisoners; TB prevalence ranging from 2% to 31%), with or without symptoms, sensitivity of Xpert MTB/RIF for the diagnosis of pulmonary TB ranged from 33% to 100%, and specificity from 92% to 100%. Reviewers calculated pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity for a range of subgroups. The non‐hospitalized high‐risk population of miners, prisoners, and household contacts of patients with TB had an overall sensitivity of 69.4% (low‐certainty evidence) and specificity of 98.8% (moderate‐certainty evidence). Sensitivity and specificity for people living with HIV were 61.8% and 98.9% overall (moderate‐ and high‐certainty evidence, respectively); estimates by prevalence of symptoms were 62.9% and 98.7% when ≥ 50% had symptoms, and 61.1% and 99.1% when < 50% had symptoms. On average, at a prevalence of 2% among non‐hospitalized people, 12 people could be wrongly diagnosed with pulmonary TB and 6 cases could be missed. At a prevalence of 10% among people with HIV (regardless of the proportion with symptoms), 9 people could be wrongly diagnosed with pulmonary TB and 38 cases could be missed. Positive likelihood ratios were high, with the probability of pulmonary TB increasing after a positive test, from 2% to 53% for non‐hospitalized people, and from 10% to 85% for people with HIV.",

High‐certainty evidence from the USA and from Sweden shows that uptake of HPV vaccination among adolescents is higher with health education than with usual practice such as health promotion media presentations (363 vs 254 per 1000 adolescents; all results on average). However, participants who received complex health education (in the form of a four‐lesson multi‐component intervention) had slightly lower rates of hepatitis B vaccine uptake compared with those who received standard government information brochures (738 vs 756 per 1000 adolescents; moderate‐certainty evidence). Low‐certainty evidence from the United Kingdom suggests that financial incentives given to participants on completion of the HPV vaccine course resulted in better vaccine uptake than invitations provided with information leaflets (284 vs 196 per 1000 adolescents). Very low‐certainty evidence from the USA suggests that financial incentives in addition to health education may result in better uptake of hepatitis B vaccination than usual care (623 vs 451 per 1000 adolescents); however, the analysis was underpowered, so differences between groups did not reach statistical significance. Moderate‐certainty evidence from the USA shows that a policy for mandatory vaccination resulted in better uptake of hepatitis B vaccination (728 vs 186 per 1000 adolescents). In schools In Tanzania, making the mandatory vaccination class‐based rather than age‐based resulted in better HPV vaccine uptake (787 vs 721 per 1000 adolescents). A single RCT assessing provider prompts compared with usual care could not draw conclusions, as key outcomes were not assessed. Low‐certainty evidence suggests that HPV vaccine uptake was higher with multi‐component provider and parent interventions when compared with usual care, but differences between groups did not reach statistical significance and the analysis was underpowered, so no conclusions can be drawn.

High‐certainty evidence from the USA and from Sweden shows that uptake of HPV vaccination among adolescents is higher with health education than with usual practice such as health promotion media presentations (363 vs 254 per 1000 adolescents; all results on average). However, participants who received complex health education (in the form of a four‐lesson multi‐component intervention) had slightly lower rates of hepatitis B vaccine uptake compared with those who received standard government information brochures (738 vs 756 per 1000 adolescents; moderate‐certainty evidence). Low‐certainty evidence from the United Kingdom suggests that financial incentives given to participants on completion of the HPV vaccine course resulted in better vaccine uptake than invitations provided with information leaflets (284 vs 196 per 1000 adolescents). Very low‐certainty evidence from the USA suggests that financial incentives in addition to health education may result in better uptake of hepatitis B vaccination than usual care (623 vs 451 per 1000 adolescents); however, the analysis was underpowered, so differences between groups did not reach statistical significance. Moderate‐certainty evidence from the USA shows that a policy for mandatory vaccination resulted in better uptake of hepatitis B vaccination (728 vs 186 per 1000 adolescents). In schools In Tanzania, making the mandatory vaccination class‐based rather than age‐based resulted in better HPV vaccine uptake (787 vs 721 per 1000 adolescents). A single RCT assessing provider prompts compared with usual care could not draw conclusions, as key outcomes were not assessed. Low‐certainty evidence suggests that HPV vaccine uptake was higher with multi‐component provider and parent interventions when compared with usual care, but differences between groups did not reach statistical significance and the analysis was underpowered, so no conclusions can be drawn. No RCTs assessed effects of interventions on vaccine‐preventable diseases or on vaccine‐related adverse events.",

However, most of the evidence is of low to moderate certainty. A multi-component provider intervention, including an education session, repeated contacts, individualized feedback, and incentives, probably improves the uptake of HPV vaccine compared to usual practice. Additionally, class-based school vaccination strategies and recipient-oriented interventions, such as education, reminders, incentives, and mandatory vaccination, have been proposed to enhance vaccination uptake among adolescents. Further research is needed to enhance adolescent vaccination uptake[1][3].",
