This procedure can be followed by immediate breast reconstruction [3]. The amount of breast tissue removed is the same as with a simple mastectomy [3]. \nThe effects of a skin-sparing mastectomy can include:\n- Temporary shoulder stiffness or pain [1]\n- Swelling of the arm or breast at the site of incision [1]\n- Damage to the nerves around the breast [1]\n- Numbness, particularly in the underarm, from lymph node removal [6]\n- Formation of hard scar tissue at the surgical site [6]\nThere is also a risk of the cancer returning or a possible need for further treatment [1]. However, several studies have shown that skin-sparing mastectomies don't have a higher risk of recurrence [5]. One study, in fact, showed a lower risk of recurrence [5]. It's important to note that this procedure may not be suitable for larger tumors or those that are close to the surface of the skin [3].",

Splinting is likely less effective than corticosteroid injections. Based on moderate‐ to low‐certainty evidence, there is little to no difference in function between splint and no active treatment at short‐ and long‐term follow‐up.

No conclusions regarding long‐term symptoms or need for referral could be made based on the available evidence. Local corticosteroid injection is likely more effective at improving overall symptoms when compared to splinting in the short and long term (308 and 511 per 1000 people difference, respectively; moderate‐certainty evidence).

            "llm_answer": "For people with carpal tunnel syndrome, the effectiveness of splinting compared to no treatment or corticosteroid injection varies:\n- **Splinting vs No Treatment**: When worn for fewer than three months, splinting may not improve carpal tunnel syndrome symptoms and probably does not improve hand function compared with no intervention[1]. However, people who used a night-time splint tended to report that overall they felt improvement compared with those that did not use a splint[1]. In the longer term (more than 3 months), the benefits of splinting are still uncertain due to few studies and inconsistent findings[1].\n- **Splinting vs Corticosteroid Injection**: Some studies suggest that splinting may make little or no difference to outcomes when given together with corticosteroid injection[1]. Splinting does not appear to improve outcomes compared with corticosteroid injection[1]. Over 24 months, surgical intervention rates were low in both groups, but less frequent in the night splint group[2]. While there were no differences in the clinical effectiveness of corticosteroid injection and night splinting, initial treatment with corticosteroid injection may not be cost-effective in the long-term compared with night splinting [2].\nIt's important to note that the effectiveness of these treatments can vary depending on the severity of the carpal tunnel syndrome and the individual patient's response to treatment..",

            "gold_answer": "For people with carpal tunnel syndrome, splinting may lead to short‐term overall improvement but little to no improvements in function and symptoms compared with no treatment. Splinting is likely less effective than corticosteroid injections. Based on moderate‐ to low‐certainty evidence, there is little to no difference in function between splint and no active treatment at short‐ and long‐term follow‐up. Splinting may result in overall improvement (964 vs 250 per 1000 people; all results on average), but little to no difference between groups in short‐term symptoms, long‐term function, and adverse effects (low‐certainty evidence). No conclusions regarding long‐term symptoms or need for referral could be made based on the available evidence. Local corticosteroid injection is likely more effective at improving overall symptoms when compared to splinting in the short and long term (308 and 511 per 1000 people difference, respectively; moderate‐certainty evidence). There was little to no difference between groups in short‐term function or long‐term quality of life (moderate‐certainty evidence), and long‐term symptoms or short‐term quality of life (low‐certainty evidence).",

            "llm_answer": "For people with carpal tunnel syndrome, the effectiveness of splinting compared to no treatment or corticosteroid injection varies:\n- **Splinting vs No Treatment**: When worn for fewer than three months, splinting may not improve carpal tunnel syndrome symptoms and probably does not improve hand function compared with no intervention[1]. However, people who used a night-time splint tended to report that overall they felt improvement compared with those that did not use a splint[1]. In the longer term (more than 3 months), the benefits of splinting are still uncertain due to few studies and inconsistent findings[1].\n- **Splinting vs Corticosteroid Injection**: Some studies suggest that splinting may make little or no difference to outcomes when given together with corticosteroid injection[1]. Splinting does not appear to improve outcomes compared with corticosteroid injection[1]. Over 24 months, surgical intervention rates were low in both groups, but less frequent in the night splint group[2]. While there were no differences in the clinical effectiveness of corticosteroid injection and night splinting, initial treatment with corticosteroid injection may not be cost-effective in the long-term compared with night splinting [2].\nIt's important to note that the effectiveness of these treatments can vary depending on the severity of the carpal tunnel syndrome and the individual patient's response to treatment..",

The prevalence of caries was 60%. The reviewers state that this high prevalence is not representative of the general population. Pooled sensitivities were 47% overall, 44% for analog/conventional methods, 49% for digital methods, and 60% for cone‐beam computed tomography (CBCT). Pooled specificities were 88%, 90%, 87% and 81%, respectively. On average, for every 1000 people tested in a population with a 28% prevalence of enamel caries lesions, 84 people could be wrongly diagnosed as having early enamel caries and 159 cases could be missed. Across the three individual tests, these average values range from 75 to 134 people wrongly diagnosed and 112 to 157 cases missed.",

However, people who used a night-time splint tended to report that overall they felt improvement compared with those that did not use a splint[1]. In the longer term (more than 3 months), the benefits of splinting are still uncertain due to few studies and inconsistent findings[1].\n- **Splinting vs Corticosteroid Injection**: Some studies suggest that splinting may make little or no difference to outcomes when given together with corticosteroid injection[1]. Splinting does not appear to improve outcomes compared with corticosteroid injection[1]. Over 24 months, surgical intervention rates were low in both groups, but less frequent in the night splint group[2]. While there were no differences in the clinical effectiveness of corticosteroid injection and night splinting, initial treatment with corticosteroid injection may not be cost-effective in the long-term compared with night splinting [2].\nIt's important to note that the effectiveness of these treatments can vary depending on the severity of the carpal tunnel syndrome and the individual patient's response to treatment..",

The biggest fear related to performing ISBCS is a bilateral case of potentially blinding severe endophthalmitis. When comparing the two methods, there may be little to no difference in the number of cases of endophthalmitis. However, the evidence was of low certainty, and all studies were underpowered to detect a bilateral case after ISBCS. Patient‐reported outcomes are likely not different between treatment groups in the randomized studies assessed (moderate‐certainty evidence). There was a very slight difference in favor of DSBCS for intraoperative complications in non‐randomized trials (33 vs 26 per 1000 people, results on average; very low‐certainty evidence), but little to no difference between groups in the number of eyes with a postoperative refraction within 1 diopter of target or the number of postoperative complications (very low‐ to moderate‐certainty evidence).",

However, people who used a night-time splint tended to report that overall they felt improvement compared with those that did not use a splint[1]. In the longer term (more than 3 months), the benefits of splinting are still uncertain due to few studies and inconsistent findings[1].\n- **Splinting vs Corticosteroid Injection**: Some studies suggest that splinting may make little or no difference to outcomes when given together with corticosteroid injection[1]. Splinting does not appear to improve outcomes compared with corticosteroid injection[1]. Over 24 months, surgical intervention rates were low in both groups, but less frequent in the night splint group[2].

However, people who used a night-time splint tended to report that overall they felt improvement compared with those that did not use a splint[1]. In the longer term (more than 3 months), the benefits of splinting are still uncertain due to few studies and inconsistent findings[1].\n- **Splinting vs Corticosteroid Injection**: Some studies suggest that splinting may make little or no difference to outcomes when given together with corticosteroid injection[1]. Splinting does not appear to improve outcomes compared with corticosteroid injection[1]. Over 24 months, surgical intervention rates were low in both groups, but less frequent in the night splint group[2].

However, people who used a night-time splint tended to report that overall they felt improvement compared with those that did not use a splint[1]. In the longer term (more than 3 months), the benefits of splinting are still uncertain due to few studies and inconsistent findings[1].\n- **Splinting vs Corticosteroid Injection**: Some studies suggest that splinting may make little or no difference to outcomes when given together with corticosteroid injection[1]. Splinting does not appear to improve outcomes compared with corticosteroid injection[1]. Over 24 months, surgical intervention rates were low in both groups, but less frequent in the night splint group[2].

Some of these results could be explained as the result of cross‐over between participants across study arms. Although pazopanib and tivozanib may result in higher response rates and increases in progression‐free survival compared with sorafenib, there might be little to no difference across agents in overall survival. Similarly, sunitinib may be more effective than everolimus for progression‐free survival and response rate, with no apparent difference in overall survival. Sorafenib versus sunitinib These two targeted agents may result in few to no differences in progression‐free survival, overall survival, serious adverse events, and response rates (low‐certainty evidence for all outcomes). Reviewers found no data on health‐related quality of life. Pazopanib versus sunitinib These two targeted agents may result in few to no differences in progression‐free survival, overall survival, and serious adverse events. However, low‐certainty evidence suggests that pazopanib may lead to a higher response rate (307 vs 248 per 1000 people; all results on average) and better results for quality of life (improvement of around 4 points on a scale from 0 to 52). Tivozanib versus sorafenib Tivozanib may result in higher progression‐free survival (446 vs 360 per 1000 people), a higher response rate (331 vs 233 per 1000 people), and fewer serious adverse events (583 vs 689 per 1000 people) compared with sorafenib. However, there might be little to no difference in overall survival or quality of life. Pazopanib versus sorafenib Pazopanib may result in higher progression‐free survival (380 vs 156 per 1000 people) and a higher response rate (463 vs 286 per 1000 people) compared with sorafenib, with similar serious adverse events. However, there might be few to no differences in overall survival and quality of life. Sunitinib versus everolimus Sunitinib probably results in higher progression‐free survival (425 vs 300 per 1000 people) and a higher response rate (266 vs 80 per 1000 people) but more serious adverse events (632 vs 471 per 1000 people).

However, people who used a night-time splint tended to report that overall they felt improvement compared with those that did not use a splint[1]. In the longer term (more than 3 months), the benefits of splinting are still uncertain due to few studies and inconsistent findings[1].\n- **Splinting vs Corticosteroid Injection**: Some studies suggest that splinting may make little or no difference to outcomes when given together with corticosteroid injection[1]. Splinting does not appear to improve outcomes compared with corticosteroid injection[1]. Over 24 months, surgical intervention rates were low in both groups, but less frequent in the night splint group[2]. While there were no differences in the clinical effectiveness of corticosteroid injection and night splinting, initial treatment with corticosteroid injection may not be cost-effective in the long-term compared with night splinting [2].\nIt's important to note that the effectiveness of these treatments can vary depending on the severity of the carpal tunnel syndrome and the individual patient's response to treatment..",

Sunitinib versus everolimus Sunitinib probably results in higher progression‐free survival (425 vs 300 per 1000 people) and a higher response rate (266 vs 80 per 1000 people) but more serious adverse events (632 vs 471 per 1000 people).
