Pazopanib versus sunitinib These two targeted agents may result in few to no differences in progression‐free survival, overall survival, and serious adverse events. However, low‐certainty evidence suggests that pazopanib may lead to a higher response rate (307 vs 248 per 1000 people; all results on average) and better results for quality of life (improvement of around 4 points on a scale from 0 to 52). Tivozanib versus sorafenib Tivozanib may result in higher progression‐free survival (446 vs 360 per 1000 people), a higher response rate (331 vs 233 per 1000 people), and fewer serious adverse events (583 vs 689 per 1000 people) compared with sorafenib. However, there might be little to no difference in overall survival or quality of life. Pazopanib versus sorafenib Pazopanib may result in higher progression‐free survival (380 vs 156 per 1000 people) and a higher response rate (463 vs 286 per 1000 people) compared with sorafenib, with similar serious adverse events. However, there might be few to no differences in overall survival and quality of life. Sunitinib versus everolimus Sunitinib probably results in higher progression‐free survival (425 vs 300 per 1000 people) and a higher response rate (266 vs 80 per 1000 people) but more serious adverse events (632 vs 471 per 1000 people). There is likely little to no difference in overall survival or quality of life.","gold_answer_terms":"Reviewers found few differences in outcomes across targeted agents when treating metastatic renal carcinoma. Some of these results could be explained as the result of cross‐over between participants across study arms. Although pazopanib and tivozanib may result in higher response rates and increases in progression‐free survival compared with sorafenib, there might be little to no difference across agents in overall survival. Similarly, sunitinib may be more effective than everolimus for progression‐free survival and response rate, with no apparent difference in overall survival. Sorafenib versus sunitinib These two targeted agents may result in few to no differences in progression‐free survival, overall survival, serious adverse events, and response rates (low‐certainty evidence for all outcomes). Reviewers found no data on health‐related quality of life. Pazopanib versus sunitinib These two targeted agents may result in few to no differences in progression‐free survival, overall survival, and serious adverse events.
