            "gold_answer": "Randomized controlled trial evidence suggests that specialist supports, overlays, mattresses and cushions may be beneficial in terms of pressure ulcer prevention compared with standard foam mattresses. The analyses comparing specialist supports with each other were often based on small numbers of participants from studies with unclear or poor methodology so conclusions could not be drawn. Compared with standard foam supports, overlays and mattresses, constant low\u2010pressure (CLP), alternating pressure (AP), or specialist supports, overlays and mattresses generally reduce the incidence of pressure ulcers in older adults in acute care settings, on general, orthopedic or rehabilitation wards, or in specialist units. Low air loss mattresses/beds also seemed to reduce the incidence of pressure sores compared with standard static mattress or intensive care unit (ICU) beds in adults in acute or long\u2010term care settings. Jay gel cushions were also beneficial in older adults in extended care facilities/nursing homes compared with standard foam cushions. When CLP and AP supports, overlays and mattresses were compared with each other (CLP versus CLP, AP versus AP, CLP versus AP), or when CLP and AP mattresses were compared with standard mattresses in patients during and after a stay in ICU, there were no apparent differences in pressure ulcer incidence between groups. A large number of the analyses comparing different non\u2010standard overlays and mattresses with each other were underpowered (often single trials with fewer than 100 patients), making it difficult either to detect differences between groups, or to have confidence in the results where differences between groups were detected. In addition, most of the studies at an unclear or high risk of bias in terms of participant selection and blinding of outcome assessors, further limiting confidence in the evidence.",

            "gold_answer": "Randomized controlled trial evidence suggests that specialist supports, overlays, mattresses and cushions may be beneficial in terms of pressure ulcer prevention compared with standard foam mattresses. The analyses comparing specialist supports with each other were often based on small numbers of participants from studies with unclear or poor methodology so conclusions could not be drawn. Compared with standard foam supports, overlays and mattresses, constant low\u2010pressure (CLP), alternating pressure (AP), or specialist supports, overlays and mattresses generally reduce the incidence of pressure ulcers in older adults in acute care settings, on general, orthopedic or rehabilitation wards, or in specialist units. Low air loss mattresses/beds also seemed to reduce the incidence of pressure sores compared with standard static mattress or intensive care unit (ICU) beds in adults in acute or long\u2010term care settings. Jay gel cushions were also beneficial in older adults in extended care facilities/nursing homes compared with standard foam cushions. When CLP and AP supports, overlays and mattresses were compared with each other (CLP versus CLP, AP versus AP, CLP versus AP), or when CLP and AP mattresses were compared with standard mattresses in patients during and after a stay in ICU, there were no apparent differences in pressure ulcer incidence between groups. A large number of the analyses comparing different non\u2010standard overlays and mattresses with each other were underpowered (often single trials with fewer than 100 patients), making it difficult either to detect differences between groups, or to have confidence in the results where differences between groups were detected. In addition, most of the studies at an unclear or high risk of bias in terms of participant selection and blinding of outcome assessors, further limiting confidence in the evidence.",
