no difference between higher‐ (therapeutic) and lower‐dose (prophylactic) anticoagulants for all‐cause mortality but a higher risk of minor bleeding with the higher dose (47 vs 20 per 1000 people; all results on average). Moderate‐certainty evidence shows that probably fewer people receiving higher‐dose anticoagulants experience pulmonary embolism (15 vs 33 per 1000 people), but more people experience major bleeding (24 vs 14 per 1000 people). Low‐certainty evidence suggests little to no difference between anticoagulation doses for the number of people who experience deep vein thrombosis. Results regarding the need for additional respiratory support were very uncertain. As for adverse events, reviewers found little to no difference between groups for stroke, major adverse limb events, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation or thrombocytopenia, although some of these analyses were probably underpowered and the results were imprecise.

Moderate‐certainty evidence shows that, when high and moderate protein concentrations of human milk fortifier were compared, infants who received high protein concentrations had increased weight gain (0.66 g\/kg\/d on average). However, there were no clear differences between groups for all other outcomes, including length gain, head circumference gain, proportion of infants who were small for gestational age, episodes of feed interruption, days to reach full enteral feeds, incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis, and occurrence of sepsis; evidence was of very low certainty or was gathered from small RCTs. No instances of mortality were reported in either treatment group (1 RCT, 45 infants), and no studies assessed cerebral palsy or developmental delay. Outcomes were measured at 28 to 29 days, at delivery date, or at hospital discharge. When moderate and low protein concentrations of human milk fortifier were compared, low‐ to very low‐certainty evidence suggests a possible increase in weight gain (2.08 g\/kg\/d on average) and in length gain (0.09 cm\/week) among infants who received moderate protein concentrations. However, no clear differences were shown among all other outcomes (very low‐certainty or small RCT evidence), with no trials assessing the proportion of infants who were small for gestational age, or who had feed intolerance, cerebral palsy, or developmental delay. All included trials were conducted in developed countries, which may limit the applicability of study findings to other settings, especially in low‐ and middle‐income countries.","gold_answer_terms":"GESTATION (gestation): The time between conception and birth, when the fetus grows and develops inside the mother’s womb.\nSEPSIS (sepsis): The immune system's overreaction to an infection or injury which can lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and death.\nRCT (rct): A study which tests the effectiveness and safety of treatments or procedures as fairly and objectively as possible.

However, low‐certainty evidence suggests that there may be no impact on exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids. Absolute data were not reported for either outcome. Adding an anti‐IL‐13 or IL‐4 agent results in small improvements in quality of life (high‐certainty evidence) and probably in asthma control (moderate‐certainty evidence) and lung function (moderate‐certainty evidence). However, the intervention also brings an increased risk of non‐severe adverse effects, including upper respiratory tract infections, headache, and injection site reactions (on average, 749 vs 720 per 1000 people; high‐certainty evidence).

According to a systematic review and meta-analysis published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, corticosteroids reduced the risk of death and disability in patients with tuberculous meningitis by 27% and 23%, respectively, compared to those who did not receive corticosteroids. However, the review also noted that the quality of the evidence was generally low and that further research is needed to confirm these findings. It's important to note that corticosteroids should only be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional and in conjunction with appropriate antituberculous therapy.","llm_model_name":"llama2_70b_chat_prompt1_answer","llm_model_prompt":"<s>[INST] <<SYS>> You are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.
