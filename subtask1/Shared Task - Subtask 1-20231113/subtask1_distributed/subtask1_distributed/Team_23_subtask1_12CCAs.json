            "llm_answer": "Surgical interventions for the management of chronic pelvic pain in women can have varying effects depending on the underlying cause of the pain and the type of surgery performed. Some common surgical interventions for chronic pelvic pain include:\n1. Laparoscopic surgery: This minimally invasive surgical procedure involves removing scar tissue, endometriosis, or other growths that may be causing pain. Studies have shown that laparoscopic surgery can improve pain symptoms in up to 70% of women with endometriosis-related chronic pelvic pain.\n2. Hysterectomy: A hysterectomy is the removal of the uterus and may be recommended for women with severe chronic pelvic pain caused by conditions such as fibroids, endometriosis, or adhesions. Studies have shown that hysterectomy can improve pain symptoms in up to 80% of women with these conditions.\n3. Pelvic floor reconstruction: This surgery involves repairing or tightening the muscles and tissues in the pelvic floor to treat conditions such as pelvic organ prolapse or rectocele, which can cause chronic pelvic pain. Studies have shown that pelvic floor reconstruction can improve pain symptoms in up to 70% of women with these conditions.\n4. Neurolysis: This surgical procedure involves damaging or destroying nerves that are causing chronic pelvic pain. Neurolysis can be performed through various techniques, including radiofrequency ablation or cryoablation. Studies have shown that neurolysis can improve pain symptoms in up to 50% of women with chronic pelvic pain.\nIt's important to note that surgical interventions may not always be effective in managing chronic pelvic pain, and the success rate can vary depending on the individual woman's condition and the type of surgery performed. Additionally, surgery may have risks and complications, so it's important to discuss the potential benefits and risks with a healthcare provider before making a decision.\nIn some cases, a multidisciplinary approach that includes pain management, physical therapy, and behavioral therapy may be recommended to manage chronic pelvic pain",

For women with advanced ovarian epithelial cancer, preoperative chemotherapy can have several effects, including:\n1. Reduction of tumor size: Chemotherapy can help shrink the tumor before surgery, making it easier to remove and reducing the risk of spreading cancer cells during surgery.\n2. Improved surgical outcomes: Preoperative chemotherapy can help reduce the risk of complications during surgery, such as bleeding or spreading of the cancer, and can improve the chances of achieving complete surgical removal of the tumor.\n3. Improved survival rates: Studies have shown that preoperative chemotherapy can improve overall survival rates for women with advanced ovarian epithelial cancer.\n4. Better assessment of chemotherapy response: Preoperative chemotherapy can help doctors assess the effectiveness of chemotherapy in shrinking the tumor and determine the best course of treatment after surgery.\n5. Reduced risk of recurrence: Preoperative chemotherapy may reduce the risk of the cancer coming back after surgery.\nIt's important to note that preoperative chemotherapy may not be suitable for all patients with advanced ovarian epithelial cancer, and the decision to use it should be made on a case-by-case basis with the guidance of a qualified healthcare professional.",

Studies have shown that handwashing with soap can reduce the risk of diarrhea by up to 40%. This is because handwashing can remove pathogens and bacteria that can cause diarrhea from the hands, preventing them from entering the body through the mouth or being transmitted to others. Additionally, handwashing can also help to reduce the spread of diarrhea in communities, which can help to prevent outbreaks and reduce the overall incidence of the disease.",

            "gold_answer": "Promoting handwashing outside hospitals can reduce the incidence of diarrhea in children. When children up to the age of 15 years attending day care centers/schools where handwashing was promoted were compared with children in day care centers/schools where no such promotion took place, high\u2010certainty evidence in high\u2010income countries shows that the incidence of diarrhea was lower when handwashing was promoted (2 versus 4 per 100 children; all results on average); low\u2010certainty evidence in low/middle\u2010income countries suggests similar benefit (15 versus 22 per 100 children developed diarrhea). Researchers reported a similar result when handwashing was promoted in community settings versus when it was not (2 versus 3 per 100 children had an episode of diarrhea; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Components of interventions to promote handwashing varied across studies, including group meetings/training, posters, handouts, and use of facilities, health instruction professionals, demonstrations, and videos.",

This is especially important for children, who are more susceptible to diarrhea and other illnesses due to their developing immune systems and poor hygiene practices.\nIn addition, promoting handwashing in communities and schools can help to reduce the spread of diarrhea and other illnesses, particularly in areas where access to clean water and sanitation facilities may be limited.\nIt's important to note that handwashing is just one aspect of preventing diarrhea.

Fewer adults with central venous catheters (CVCs) inserted experienced occlusions of CVC with heparin than with saline locking (on average, 49 vs 70 per 1000 people at 1 to 231 days; low certainty evidence). There were no clear differences between groups in duration of catheter patency, CVC\u2010related bloodstream infections, hemorrhage from any site in the body, heparin\u2010induced thrombocytopenia, CVC\u2010related thrombosis, or mortality (low to very low\u2010certainty evidence). Event rates were generally low with either form of locking. No studies assessed allergic reactions to heparin.",

            "llm_answer": "Heparin and normal saline are both commonly used for locking central venous catheters, but they have different mechanisms of action and advantages. Heparin is an anticoagulant that prevents thrombus formation by inhibiting the activity of thrombin, while normal saline is a neutral solution that does not have any anticoagulant properties.\nHeparin has been shown to be more effective than normal saline in preventing thrombosis and catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) in some studies. Heparin's anticoagulant properties help to prevent the formation of thrombi within the catheter, which can lead to catheter occlusion or embolism. Additionally, heparin may have antimicrobial properties that can help to reduce the risk of CRBSIs.\nHowever, heparin can also have some disadvantages compared to normal saline. Heparin can cause bleeding complications, particularly in patients with bleeding disorders or concurrent use of other anticoagulants. Heparin can also be more expensive than normal saline.\nNormal saline, on the other hand, is a simpler and less expensive solution that can still provide effective catheter locking. Normal saline may be a better choice for patients with bleeding disorders or those who are at high risk of bleeding complications. However, normal saline may not be as effective as heparin in preventing thrombosis and CRBSIs, particularly in high-risk patients.\nIn summary, heparin and normal saline both have their advantages and disadvantages for locking central venous catheters. Heparin may be more effective in preventing thrombosis and CRBSIs, but it can also increase the risk of bleeding complications. Normal saline is simpler and less expensive, but it may not be as effective in preventing thrombosis and CRBSIs. The choice between heparin and normal saline will depend on the individual patient's needs and risk factors.",

Fewer adults with central venous catheters (CVCs) inserted experienced occlusions of CVC with heparin than with saline locking (on average, 49 vs 70 per 1000 people at 1 to 231 days; low certainty evidence). There were no clear differences between groups in duration of catheter patency, CVC\u2010related bloodstream infections, hemorrhage from any site in the body, heparin\u2010induced thrombocytopenia, CVC\u2010related thrombosis, or mortality (low to very low\u2010certainty evidence). Event rates were generally low with either form of locking. No studies assessed allergic reactions to heparin.",

            "llm_answer": "Heparin and normal saline are both commonly used to lock central venous catheters, but they have some differences in terms of their effects and uses.\nHeparin is an anticoagulant that works by inhibiting the activity of thrombin, a clotting factor in the blood. When used to lock a central venous catheter, heparin helps to prevent the formation of blood clots within the catheter, which can occlude the catheter and prevent it from functioning properly. Heparin is typically used in patients who are at high risk of developing blood clots, such as those with a history of venous thromboembolism or atrial fibrillation.\nNormal saline, on the other hand, is a sterile solution of sodium chloride in water. When used to lock a central venous catheter, normal saline helps to maintain the patency of the catheter by flushing out any debris or blood that may have accumulated within the catheter. Normal saline is typically used in patients who are not at high risk of developing blood clots.\nIn terms of efficacy, heparin has been shown to be more effective than normal saline in preventing blood clots in central venous catheters. However, heparin can also increase the risk of bleeding complications, particularly in patients with a history of bleeding disorders or concurrent use of other anticoagulant medications. Normal saline, on the other hand, is generally considered safe and well-tolerated, but it may not be as effective in preventing blood clots as heparin.\nUltimately, the choice between heparin and normal saline for locking central venous catheters depends on the individual patient's needs and medical history. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the most appropriate solution for each patient.",

Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that it is likely that more people experienced seizures and bone fractures with fluoxetine (on average, 10 and 19 difference per 1000 people, respectively).

The benefits of fluoxetine for people with stroke include:\n* Improved mood: Fluoxetine can help reduce symptoms of depression, anxiety, and anxiety-related disorders, which are common after a stroke.\n* Enhanced recovery: Fluoxetine may help improve cognitive function, motor function, and quality of life in people who have had a stroke.\n* Reduced risk of dementia: Some studies suggest that fluoxetine may reduce the risk of developing dementia in people who have had a stroke.\nHowever, there are also potential harms associated with using fluoxetine after a stroke, including:\n* Increased risk of bleeding: Fluoxetine can increase the risk of bleeding, which can be dangerous for people who have had a stroke and may already have bleeding in the brain.\n* Interaction with other medications: Fluoxetine can interact with other medications that are commonly used after a stroke, such as anticoagulants, and may increase the risk of bleeding.\n* Nausea and vomiting: Fluoxetine can cause nausea and vomiting, which can be uncomfortable and may lead to dehydration.\n* Sexual dysfunction: Fluoxetine can cause sexual dysfunction, such as decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, and decreased orgasmic capacity.\nIt's important to note that the benefits and harms of fluoxetine for people with stroke can vary depending on the individual, and the decision to prescribe it should be made on a case-by-case basis. It's important to discuss the potential benefits and harms with a healthcare provider and to carefully weigh the risks and benefits before starting treatment.",

While there is some research on the use of fluoxetine in people who have had a stroke, it's important to note that the evidence is limited and the benefits and harms may vary depending on the individual.\nBenefits:\n* Fluoxetine may help improve mood and reduce symptoms of depression, which are common after a stroke.\n* It may also help improve cognitive function and reduce the risk of developing dementia.\n* Some studies suggest that fluoxetine may have neuroprotective effects and may help reduce inflammation in the brain after a stroke.\nHarms:\n* Fluoxetine can increase the risk of bleeding, which may be a concern for people who have had a stroke and are taking other medications that can also increase the risk of bleeding, such as anticoagulants.\n* It can also cause a range of side effects, including nausea, dizziness, and sexual dysfunction.\n* Some studies have suggested that SSRIs, including fluoxetine, may increase the risk of bone fractures, particularly in older adults.\nIt's important to note that the decision to prescribe fluoxetine after a stroke should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the individual's medical history, current medications, and other factors. It's important to discuss the potential benefits and harms with a healthcare provider and to carefully weigh the risks and benefits before starting treatment. Additionally, it's important to note that fluoxetine is not a substitute for other treatments that are proven to be effective for stroke recovery, such as physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy.",

            "gold_answer": "Among adults and children with drug\u2010resistant epilepsy, oxcarbazepine seems to be more effective than placebo for reducing seizures, and higher doses seem to be more effective than lower doses. However, this must be balanced against increases in adverse effects. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that oxcarbazepine (600\u20102400 mg/day or 30\u201060 mg/kg/day) achieved at least a 50% reduction in seizure frequency when compared with an alternative dose of oxcarbazepine (10 mg/kg/day or 600 mg/day) or compared with placebo (391 vs 217 per 1000 people; all results on average). Moderate\u2010certainty evidence probably shows a higher median percentage of seizure reduction per 28 days with oxcarbazepine, compared with placebo (26%\u201083% vs 8%\u201029%); and that there was a dose response with higher doses, leading to greater reductions in seizure frequency. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that more people had seizure freedom with higher oxcarbazepine doses than with placebo or lower doses of oxcarbazepine (22 vs 8 per 1000 people). Rates of adverse events (ataxia, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, somnolence, headache, hyponatremia, vertigo, diplopia, rash, tremor, pyrexia, abnormal gait, abdominal pain, nystagmus, viral infection, vomiting, abnormal vision, and upper respiratory tract infection) were higher with higher oxcarbazepine doses than with placebo or lower oxcarbazepine doses. More people had treatment withdrawals with oxcarbazepine than with placebo and with higher doses of oxcarbazepine than with lower doses (moderate\u2010certainty evidence; 377 vs 215 per 1000 people).",
            "gold_answer_terms": "PLACEBO (placebo): an inactive substance; a pill/liquid that contains no medicine\nSOMNOLENCE (somnolence): sleepiness\nHYPONATREMIA (hyponatremia): low blood sodium level\nABDOMINAL (abdominal): Of the abdomen.",

            "llm_answer": "Oxcarbazepine is a medication that is sometimes used as an add-on therapy for people with drug-resistant focal epilepsy, which means that their seizures have not been controlled by other medications. The benefits of supplemental oxcarbazepine for people with drug-resistant focal epilepsy include:\n* Improved seizure control: Oxcarbazepine can help reduce the frequency and severity of seizures in some people with drug-resistant focal epilepsy.\n* Better tolerability: Oxcarbazepine is generally well-tolerated and has a more favorable side effect profile compared to other add-on medications.\n* Potential for monotherapy: In some cases, oxcarbazepine may be effective enough to be used as a single medication, which can simplify treatment regimens and reduce the risk of drug interactions.\nHowever, there are also potential harms associated with supplemental oxcarbazepine, including:\n* Side effects: Like all medications, oxcarbazepine can cause side effects, such as dizziness, fatigue, and weight gain.\n* Lack of efficacy: Oxcarbazepine may not be effective for everyone with drug-resistant focal epilepsy, and it may not be possible to predict who will respond well to the medication.\n* Drug interactions: Oxcarbazepine can interact with other medications, which can affect its efficacy or increase the risk of side effects.\n* Cost: Oxcarbazepine can be expensive, particularly for people who do not have adequate health insurance coverage.\nIt is important to note that the decision to use supplemental oxcarbazepine for drug-resistant focal epilepsy should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the individual's medical history, current treatment regimen, and personal preferences. A healthcare professional can help weigh the potential benefits and harms of oxcarbazepine and determine whether it is an appropriate treatment option.",

            "gold_answer": "Among adults and children with drug\u2010resistant epilepsy, oxcarbazepine seems to be more effective than placebo for reducing seizures, and higher doses seem to be more effective than lower doses. However, this must be balanced against increases in adverse effects. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that oxcarbazepine (600\u20102400 mg/day or 30\u201060 mg/kg/day) achieved at least a 50% reduction in seizure frequency when compared with an alternative dose of oxcarbazepine (10 mg/kg/day or 600 mg/day) or compared with placebo (391 vs 217 per 1000 people; all results on average). Moderate\u2010certainty evidence probably shows a higher median percentage of seizure reduction per 28 days with oxcarbazepine, compared with placebo (26%\u201083% vs 8%\u201029%); and that there was a dose response with higher doses, leading to greater reductions in seizure frequency. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that more people had seizure freedom with higher oxcarbazepine doses than with placebo or lower doses of oxcarbazepine (22 vs 8 per 1000 people). Rates of adverse events (ataxia, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, somnolence, headache, hyponatremia, vertigo, diplopia, rash, tremor, pyrexia, abnormal gait, abdominal pain, nystagmus, viral infection, vomiting, abnormal vision, and upper respiratory tract infection) were higher with higher oxcarbazepine doses than with placebo or lower oxcarbazepine doses. More people had treatment withdrawals with oxcarbazepine than with placebo and with higher doses of oxcarbazepine than with lower doses (moderate\u2010certainty evidence; 377 vs 215 per 1000 people).",

The benefits of supplemental oxcarbazepine for this condition include:\n* Reduced frequency and severity of seizures: Studies have shown that oxcarbazepine can be effective in reducing the frequency and severity of seizures in people with drug-resistant focal epilepsy.\n* Improved quality of life: By reducing the frequency and severity of seizures, oxcarbazepine can improve a person's quality of life, allowing them to engage in activities they may have previously avoided due to seizure activity.\n* Potential for monotherapy: In some cases, oxcarbazepine may be effective enough to be used as a monotherapy, allowing patients to discontinue other medications that may have been ineffective or poorly tolerated.\nHowever, there are also potential harms associated with supplemental oxcarbazepine, including:\n* Side effects: Common side effects of oxcarbazepine include dizziness, fatigue, and gastrointestinal disturbances. Less common side effects can include allergic reactions, infections, and changes in mood or behavior.\n* Drug interactions: Oxcarbazepine can interact with other medications, including other anticonvulsants, and can increase the risk of adverse effects.\n* Cost: Oxcarbazepine can be expensive, particularly for those without insurance coverage.\n* Limited evidence: While oxcarbazepine has been shown to be effective in some studies, the evidence is limited, and more research is needed to fully understand its benefits and harms in treating drug-resistant focal epilepsy.\nIt's important to note that the decision to use oxcarbazepine as an add-on treatment for drug-resistant focal epilepsy should be made on a case-by-case basis, in consultation with a healthcare provider who can carefully weigh the potential benefits and harms.",

Moderate\u2010quality evidence showed that this benefit was not sustained in the longer\u2010term (5 years). Low\u2010quality evidence suggests there was no benefit of an adjunctive corticosteroid in terms of reducing rates of disabling neurological deficit, ether within 24 months or at 5 years. There was no apparent impact of adjunctive corticosteroids on the incidences of hepatitis, hyperglycemia/glycosuria, gastrointestinal bleeding, or invasive bacterial infection but event rates were very low meaning conclusions cannot be drawn.",

Studies have consistently demonstrated that corticosteroids reduce the risk of death and disability in patients with tuberculous meningitis, particularly in those with severe disease. The use of corticosteroids has been associated with a significant reduction in mortality rates, from approximately 30-40% in untreated patients to around 10-20% in patients receiving corticosteroids. Additionally, corticosteroids have been shown to reduce the risk of long-term disability, such as hearing loss and cognitive impairment.

Moderate\u2010quality evidence showed that this benefit was not sustained in the longer\u2010term (5 years). Low\u2010quality evidence suggests there was no benefit of an adjunctive corticosteroid in terms of reducing rates of disabling neurological deficit, ether within 24 months or at 5 years. There was no apparent impact of adjunctive corticosteroids on the incidences of hepatitis, hyperglycemia/glycosuria, gastrointestinal bleeding, or invasive bacterial infection but event rates were very low meaning conclusions cannot be drawn.",

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers found no conclusive RCT evidence suggesting that administration of probiotics to pregnant women was superior or inferior to placebo in reducing morbidity or mortality in preterm infants. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that in pregnant women who received probiotics, the risk of preterm birth (< 37 weeks) and miscarriage/stillbirth was no more or less likely compared with those who did not receive probiotics. Only one RCT (159 infants) reported no incidences of early neonatal sepsis (\u2264 3 days) in either trial arm. For most outcomes, event rates were very low or there were no events in both arms. There is a lack of data on neonatal short\u2010term (early or late sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, neonatal death, hospital stay) and long\u2010term (major neurodevelopmental disability) potential benefits or harms following probiotic administration. None of the trials included women with a previous history of preterm birth, multiple pregnancy, or uterine anomaly. Reviewers did not assess serious adverse maternal or neonatal adverse events following use of probiotics.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "RCT (rct): A study which tests the effectiveness and safety of treatments or procedures as fairly and objectively as possible. By randomly assigning patients to different treatments for the same problem, the results can be assessed equally with the aim of discovering the best possible procedure for the condition.\nPLACEBO (placebo): an inactive substance; a pill/liquid that contains no medicine\nMORBIDITY (morbidity): undesired result or complication\nMORTALITY (mortality): death\nRISK (risk): The chance that an activity or hazard will give rise to harm. Risk is generally given in terms of numerical odds (1 in 10) or percentages (10%).\nSEPSIS (sepsis): The immune system's overreaction to an infection or injury which can lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and death.\nPOTENTIAL (potential): possible\nPOTENTIATE (potentiate): increase or multiply the effect of a drug or toxin (poison) by giving another drug or toxin at the same time (sometimes an unintentional result)\nPOTENTIATOR (potentiator): an agent that helps another agent work better\nASSESS (assess): to learn about, measure, evaluate, look at",

            "llm_answer": "Yes, probiotics administered to pregnant women have been shown to help prevent morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that can help maintain a healthy gut microbiome, which is important for the development and function of various bodily systems, including the immune system.\nStudies have found that probiotics can help reduce the risk of preterm birth, which is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Probiotics have also been shown to reduce the risk of other complications in preterm infants, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious condition that can cause damage to the intestines.\nIt's important to note that not all probiotics are the same, and some strains have been found to be more effective than others in preventing morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. For example, the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any supplements during pregnancy, including probiotics, to ensure safety and effectiveness. Additionally, it's important to note that while probiotics can help reduce the risk of complications, they are not a guarantee against them, and other factors such as proper prenatal care, a healthy diet, and a safe delivery are also important for a healthy pregnancy and baby.",
