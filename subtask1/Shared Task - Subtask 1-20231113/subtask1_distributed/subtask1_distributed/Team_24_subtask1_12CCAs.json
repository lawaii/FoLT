            "gold_answer": "Reviewers identified studies that assessed the accuracy of Xpert Ultra performed on four types of specimens (sputum, gastric aspirate, stool, nasopharyngeal) for diagnosing pulmonary TB in children, using culture as the reference standard. Pooled specificity was at least 94% regardless of the specimen used. Pooled sensitivities were more variable, ranging from 43.7% (nasopharyngeal specimens) to 75.3% (sputum). This variation in sensitivity means that specimen type may impact the test's ability to rule out pulmonary TB (the lower the sensitivity, the higher the number of false\u2010negative results). At a prevalence of 10%, the number of children with pulmonary TB that would be missed for every 1000 children tested would be 25 with sputum specimens, 30 with gastric aspirate specimens, 44 with stool specimens, and 56 nasopharyngeal specimens. With such high specificities, a positive Xpert MTB/RIF test using any specimen will substantially increase the probability of pulmonary TB. At a pretest probability of 10%, after a positive test, the probability of TB would increase to approximately 74% with sputum specimens, 57% with gastric aspirate specimens, 75% with stool specimens, and 66% with nasopharyngeal specimens. This probability would decrease to 3% to 6% after a negative test. Reviewers assessment of the certainty of evidence across specimens ranged from high to very low for sensitivity and from high to moderate for specificity.",

It teaches coping skills and strategies to manage emotions and behaviors in a healthier way. Research has shown that CBT can significantly reduce the frequency and severity of self-harm behaviors.\nDBT, on the other hand, focuses on the development of mindfulness skills, emotional regulation, and interpersonal effectiveness. It aims to help individuals manage their emotions and behaviors in a more adaptive way, which can lead to a reduction in self-harm behaviors. DBT also emphasizes the importance of building a supportive community and improving relationships, which can provide a sense of safety and stability for individuals who self-harm.\nBoth CBT and DBT are typically provided on an individual basis, and the effects can vary depending on the individual's specific needs and circumstances. However, research has shown that both therapies can be effective in reducing self-harm behaviors and improving overall mental health.\nIt's important to note that therapy alone may not be enough to treat self-harm behaviors, and it's often recommended to combine therapy with other forms of treatment, such as medication or support groups. It's also important to find a qualified therapist who has experience working with individuals who self-harm.",

            "gold_answer": "In a young, healthy, predominantly male population, high\u2010dose alcohol decreased blood pressure initially, then increased blood pressure after 13 hours of consumption. Heart rate was increased at all times within 24 hours of high\u2010dose alcohol intake. Reviewers found moderate\u2010certainty evidence showing that alcohol at low dose (\u2264 14 g) did not affect blood pressure within six hours of consumption, but at medium dose (14 g to \u2264 30 g), alcohol reduced systolic/diastolic blood pressure by 5.6 mmHg and 4.0 mmHg, respectively (all values on average). When high\u2010dose alcohol (> 30 g) was consumed, moderate\u2010 to low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that a reduction in blood pressure (systolic by 3.7 mmHg and diastolic by 1.7 mmHg within 12 hours of consumption) was seen initially, but this was followed by an increase after 13 hours (systolic by 3.7 mmHg and diastolic by 2.4 mmHg). Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that alcohol elevated heart rate regardless of dose and at all times within 24 hours of intake (although not all values reached statistical significance). This increase in heart rate ranged from 4.6 bpm within six hours of medium\u2010dose alcohol intake to 6.2 bpm after 7 to 12 hours of high\u2010dose alcohol. Heart rate remained elevated by 2.7 bpm after 13 hours of high\u2010dose alcohol consumption. Of note, these findings cannot be extrapolated to older people, those with co\u2010morbidities, or the female population.",

When high\u2010dose alcohol (> 30 g) was consumed, moderate\u2010 to low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that a reduction in blood pressure (systolic by 3.7 mmHg and diastolic by 1.7 mmHg within 12 hours of consumption) was seen initially, but this was followed by an increase after 13 hours (systolic by 3.7 mmHg and diastolic by 2.4 mmHg). Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that alcohol elevated heart rate regardless of dose and at all times within 24 hours of intake (although not all values reached statistical significance). This increase in heart rate ranged from 4.6 bpm within six hours of medium\u2010dose alcohol intake to 6.2 bpm after 7 to 12 hours of high\u2010dose alcohol. Heart rate remained elevated by 2.7 bpm after 13 hours of high\u2010dose alcohol consumption. Of note, these findings cannot be extrapolated to older people, those with co\u2010morbidities, or the female population.",

            "llm_answer": "The effects of different alcohol doses on blood pressure and heart rate in adults can vary depending on several factors, such as age, gender, weight, and overall health status. However, here are some general trends that have been observed in scientific studies:\n* Low alcohol dose (up to 1 drink for women and up to 2 drinks for men):\n\t+ Blood pressure: May have a small, temporary decrease in blood pressure, especially in people who are normotensive (have normal blood pressure).\n\t+ Heart rate: May have a small, temporary increase in heart rate.\n* Medium alcohol dose (1-2 drinks for women, 2-4 drinks for men):\n\t+ Blood pressure: May cause a moderate decrease in blood pressure, especially in people who are hypertensive (have high blood pressure).\n\t+ Heart rate: May have a moderate increase in heart rate.\n* High alcohol dose (more than 4 drinks for women, more than 6 drinks for men):\n\t+ Blood pressure: May cause a significant decrease in blood pressure, which can lead to hypotension (low blood pressure) and dizziness.\n\t+ Heart rate: May have a significant increase in heart rate, which can lead to palpitations and other cardiovascular problems.\nIt's important to note that these effects can vary depending on individual factors and can also be influenced by other factors such as food consumption, physical activity, and overall health status. Additionally, excessive alcohol consumption can have long-term negative effects on the cardiovascular system, such as increasing the risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke. It's always recommended to drink alcohol in moderation and to consult with a healthcare professional if you have concerns about your alcohol consumption or its effects on your health.",

The effects of antiplatelet agents in this setting include:\n* Reduced risk of pulmonary embolism: Antiplatelet agents can help prevent the clot from breaking loose and traveling to the lungs, which can cause a life-threatening pulmonary embolism.\n* Reduced risk of clot propagation: Antiplatelet agents can inhibit the growth of the clot, reducing the risk of further clot formation and potentially preventing the clot from becoming larger and more dangerous.\n* Improved blood flow: Antiplatelet agents can help improve blood flow by reducing the formation of new clots and improving the patency of the affected vein.\n* Reduced risk of post-thrombotic syndrome: Antiplatelet agents may reduce the risk of post-thrombotic syndrome, a condition characterized by pain, swelling, and skin discoloration in the affected limb.\nIt's important to note that antiplatelet agents are not a substitute for anticoagulation therapy, which is the primary treatment for DVT. Anticoagulation therapy, such as warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), is used to prevent the clot from growing and to prevent new clots from forming. Antiplatelet agents are typically used in combination with anticoagulation therapy in the acute phase of DVT.",

The main effect of these medications is to prevent the formation of new blood clots and to prevent the existing clots from growing larger. This can help to reduce the risk of complications such as pulmonary embolism, which can be life-threatening. Additionally, antiplatelet agents can help to reduce the pain and swelling associated with DVT. However, it's important to note that these medications do not dissolve the clot, and they do not guarantee that the clot will not break loose and travel to the lungs. In some cases, other treatments such as thrombolysis or filter placement may be necessary. It's important to discuss the best treatment plan with a healthcare professional.",

Reviewers identified moderate\u2010certainty evidence from one Cochrane Review that reported a possibly effective intervention (prophylactic caffeine for endotracheal extubation in preterm infants; on average, 62 vs 115 per 1000 children developed cerebral palsy) and from another Cochrane Review that reported a possibly harmful intervention (early [< 8 days of age] postnatal corticosteroids; on average, 128 vs 88 per 1000 children developed cerebral palsy). Reviewers classified all other interventions for neonatal conditions such as patent ductus arteriosus, respiratory distress syndrome, and jaundice as possibly ineffective in terms of preventing cerebral palsy (etamsylate, fluid therapy, prophylactic indomethacin, synthetic surfactant, and prophylactic phototherapy; moderate\u2010certainty evidence) or having uncertain effects (15 interventions with very low\u2010certainty evidence). For other outcomes, moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that prophylactic caffeine probably reduces mortality/major disability at 18 to 21 months' corrected age (446 vs 525 per 1000 children) and prophylactic phototherapy probably reduces neurodevelopmental impairment at 18 to 22 months (259 vs 305 per 1000 children).

Compared with tri\u2010weekly paclitaxel plus carboplatin for first\u2010line treatment of women with epithelial ovarian cancer and excellent performance status, high\u2010certainty evidence shows that a weekly regimen of combined paclitaxel and carboplatin results in minimal to no important difference in overall survival; however, moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that it probably improves progression\u2010free survival (159 vs 177 progressed/died per 1000 women; all results on average). Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that probably more women receiving the weekly regimen have grade 3 or 4 anemia than in the tri\u2010weekly group (125 vs 80 per 1000 women), but differences may be minimal to no important for other grade 3 or 4 adverse events (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, neuropathy, transaminitis, fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, anorexia, diarrhea, vomiting, and hypersensitivity), febrile neutropenia, and any\u2010grade alopecia or mucositis.

Compared with tri\u2010weekly paclitaxel plus carboplatin for first\u2010line treatment of women with epithelial ovarian cancer and excellent performance status, high\u2010certainty evidence shows that a weekly regimen of combined paclitaxel and carboplatin results in minimal to no important difference in overall survival; however, moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that it probably improves progression\u2010free survival (159 vs 177 progressed/died per 1000 women; all results on average). Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that probably more women receiving the weekly regimen have grade 3 or 4 anemia than in the tri\u2010weekly group (125 vs 80 per 1000 women), but differences may be minimal to no important for other grade 3 or 4 adverse events (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, neuropathy, transaminitis, fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, anorexia, diarrhea, vomiting, and hypersensitivity), febrile neutropenia, and any\u2010grade alopecia or mucositis.

            "gold_answer": "Evidence suggests that for women with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer, and compared with chemotherapy alone (cisplatin or topotecan plus paclitaxel), bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) plus chemotherapy may improve overall survival (on average, 701 vs 791 per 1000 women died; median survival time 16.8 vs 13.3 months; low\u2010certainty evidence) and progression\u2010free survival (on average, 623 vs 916 per 1000 women progressed; median progression\u2010free survival time 8.2 vs 6.0 months; based on 452 women) with little to no difference between groups in terms of overall adverse event rate (experienced by > 95% of women in both groups; based on 439 women). Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that bevacizumab plus chemotherapy is probably more commonly associated with serious adverse events (on average, 518 vs 361 per 1000 women). Bevacizumab plus chemotherapy is probably more commonly associated with some specific adverse events; however, results for these analyses were imprecise, and the magnitude of the difference is unclear (serious hemorrhage 10 to 205 vs 9 per 1000 women; serious thromboembolic events 28 to 238 vs 18 per 1000 women; gastrointestinal perforations or fistulae, 11 to 608 vs 5 per 1000 women; hypertension, 92 to 678 vs 18 per 1000 women). Reviewers identified little evidence (59 to 228 women) comparing: pazopanib plus lapatinib to either therapy alone (combination arm discontinued due to rates of mortality and withdrawal from treatment); cediranib plus chemotherapy to chemotherapy alone; or apatinib plus chemotherapy or chemotherapy/brachytherapy to chemotherapy or chemotherapy/brachytherapy alone.",

In the case of cervical cancer, VEGF-targeting therapy has been shown to have a positive effect on the progression of the disease, particularly in women with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer.\nStudies have shown that VEGF-targeting therapy can help to shrink the tumor, reduce the risk of disease progression, and improve overall survival rates for women with advanced cervical cancer. Additionally, VEGF-targeting therapy may also help to reduce the risk of adverse effects associated with traditional chemotherapy and radiation treatments, such as damage to healthy cells and tissues.\nHowever, it is important to note that VEGF-targeting therapy is not a standalone treatment for cervical cancer, and its effectiveness may vary depending on the stage and aggressiveness of the cancer. It is typically used in combination with other treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation, and its use should be carefully evaluated and monitored by a qualified healthcare professional.\nIn summary, VEGF-targeting therapy can be an effective treatment option for women with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer, particularly when used in combination with other treatments.

Studies have shown that chest X-rays may not always reveal abnormalities in the early stages of COVID-19, and may not be able to distinguish between COVID-19 and other respiratory infections.\nChest CT scans, on the other hand, have been shown to be more accurate than chest X-rays for diagnosing COVID-19. CT scans can provide detailed images of the lungs and can help identify characteristic signs of COVID-19, such as ground glass opacities and consolidation. However, the accuracy of CT scans can also depend on the quality of the imaging equipment and the expertise of the radiologist interpreting the images.\nIt's important to note that both chest X-rays and CT scans are not perfect and may not always be able to diagnose COVID-19 with certainty. Other factors, such as clinical symptoms, laboratory tests, and medical history, should also be taken into account when making a diagnosis.\nIt's also important to note that the accuracy of these tests may vary depending on the population being tested. For example, the accuracy of chest X-rays and CT scans may be lower in populations with a high prevalence of other respiratory diseases or conditions that can mimic COVID-19.\nIn summary, while chest CT scans may be more accurate than chest X-rays for diagnosing COVID-19, the accuracy of both tests can vary depending on the specific circumstances and population being tested.

Moderate\u2010quality evidence showed that this benefit was not sustained in the longer\u2010term (5 years). Low\u2010quality evidence suggests there was no benefit of an adjunctive corticosteroid in terms of reducing rates of disabling neurological deficit, ether within 24 months or at 5 years. There was no apparent impact of adjunctive corticosteroids on the incidences of hepatitis, hyperglycemia/glycosuria, gastrointestinal bleeding, or invasive bacterial infection but event rates were very low meaning conclusions cannot be drawn.",

Studies have consistently demonstrated that corticosteroids reduce the risk of death and disability in patients with tuberculous meningitis, particularly in those with severe disease. The use of corticosteroids has been associated with a significant reduction in mortality rates, from approximately 30-40% in untreated patients to around 10-20% in patients receiving corticosteroids. Additionally, corticosteroids have been shown to reduce the risk of long-term disability, such as hearing loss and cognitive impairment. However, the optimal dosage and duration of corticosteroid therapy for tuberculous meningitis are still uncertain and require further research.",

Moderate\u2010quality evidence showed that this benefit was not sustained in the longer\u2010term (5 years). Low\u2010quality evidence suggests there was no benefit of an adjunctive corticosteroid in terms of reducing rates of disabling neurological deficit, ether within 24 months or at 5 years. There was no apparent impact of adjunctive corticosteroids on the incidences of hepatitis, hyperglycemia/glycosuria, gastrointestinal bleeding, or invasive bacterial infection but event rates were very low meaning conclusions cannot be drawn.",

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers found no conclusive RCT evidence suggesting that administration of probiotics to pregnant women was superior or inferior to placebo in reducing morbidity or mortality in preterm infants. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that in pregnant women who received probiotics, the risk of preterm birth (< 37 weeks) and miscarriage/stillbirth was no more or less likely compared with those who did not receive probiotics. Only one RCT (159 infants) reported no incidences of early neonatal sepsis (\u2264 3 days) in either trial arm. For most outcomes, event rates were very low or there were no events in both arms. There is a lack of data on neonatal short\u2010term (early or late sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, neonatal death, hospital stay) and long\u2010term (major neurodevelopmental disability) potential benefits or harms following probiotic administration. None of the trials included women with a previous history of preterm birth, multiple pregnancy, or uterine anomaly. Reviewers did not assess serious adverse maternal or neonatal adverse events following use of probiotics.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "RCT (rct): A study which tests the effectiveness and safety of treatments or procedures as fairly and objectively as possible. By randomly assigning patients to different treatments for the same problem, the results can be assessed equally with the aim of discovering the best possible procedure for the condition.\nPLACEBO (placebo): an inactive substance; a pill/liquid that contains no medicine\nMORBIDITY (morbidity): undesired result or complication\nMORTALITY (mortality): death\nRISK (risk): The chance that an activity or hazard will give rise to harm. Risk is generally given in terms of numerical odds (1 in 10) or percentages (10%).\nSEPSIS (sepsis): The immune system's overreaction to an infection or injury which can lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and death.\nPOTENTIAL (potential): possible\nPOTENTIATE (potentiate): increase or multiply the effect of a drug or toxin (poison) by giving another drug or toxin at the same time (sometimes an unintentional result)\nPOTENTIATOR (potentiator): an agent that helps another agent work better\nASSESS (assess): to learn about, measure, evaluate, look at",

            "llm_answer": "Yes, probiotics administered to pregnant women have been shown to help prevent morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that can help maintain a healthy gut microbiome, which is important for the development and function of various bodily systems, including the immune system.\nStudies have found that probiotics can help reduce the risk of preterm birth, which is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Probiotics have also been shown to reduce the risk of other complications in preterm infants, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious condition that can cause damage to the intestines.\nIt's important to note that not all probiotics are the same, and some strains have been found to be more effective than others in preventing morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. For example, the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any supplements during pregnancy, including probiotics, to ensure safety and effectiveness. Additionally, it's important to note that while probiotics can help reduce the risk of complications, they are not a guarantee against them, and other factors such as proper prenatal care, a healthy diet, and a safe delivery are also important for a healthy pregnancy and baby.",
