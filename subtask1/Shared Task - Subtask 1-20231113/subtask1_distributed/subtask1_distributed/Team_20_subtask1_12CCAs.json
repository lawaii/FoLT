The choice between the two depends on various factors, including patient preference, medical history, and surgeon's discretion. Here's a comparison of the two options:\nLocal Anesthesia:\n1. Advantages:\n\t* Less invasive, as it only numbs the area where the surgery is performed.\n\t* Quicker recovery time compared to general anesthesia.\n\t* Lower risk of complications, such as respiratory and cardiac problems.\n\t* Allows the patient to stay awake and alert during the procedure.\n2. Disadvantages:\n\t* The patient may feel discomfort or pain during the procedure.\n\t* Limited pain relief options if needed.\n\t* May not be suitable for patients with certain medical conditions, such as heart disease or lung disease.\nGeneral Anesthesia:\n1. Advantages:\n\t* Provides complete unconsciousness, ensuring the patient feels no pain or discomfort during the procedure.\n\t* Can be used for more complex surgeries or those that require a longer duration.\n\t* Allows for better control of breathing and circulation during the procedure.\n2. Disadvantages:\n\t* Requires more time for recovery compared to local anesthesia.\n\t* Increased risk of complications, such as respiratory and cardiac problems.\n\t* May cause nausea, dizziness, and confusion after the procedure.\nUltimately, the choice between local and general anesthesia for carotid endarterectomy should be discussed with a qualified medical professional, taking into account the patient's individual needs and medical history.",

A systematic review and meta-analysis published in the journal Fertility and Sterility found that double IUI resulted in a higher pregnancy rate (22.4% vs 14.1%) and lower miscarriage rate (12.8% vs 20.5%) compared to single IUI. However, the risk of multiple pregnancies was higher with double IUI (20.6% vs 7.9%). It's important to note that the success of IUI is influenced by various factors, including age, cause of subfertility, and the number of follicles retrieved.

However, only the data for fewer serious hypoglycemic episodes with insulin detemir than NPH reached statistical significance (on average, 2 versus 12 per 1000 people experienced serious hypoglycemia). Other parameters, such as health\u2010related quality of life, all\u2010cause mortality, diabetes\u2010related complications, change in glycosylated hemoglobin, and adverse events, were comparable in all groups. However, the data were of very low to low certainty, so no firm conclusions can be drawn.",

All three are used to treat adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.\nCompared to NPH insulin, insulin glargine and insulin detemir have several advantages:\n1. More consistent and stable blood sugar control: Insulin glargine and detemir have a more consistent and stable glucose-lowering effect throughout the day, whereas NPH insulin can have a peak effect that may cause fluctuations in blood sugar levels.\n2. Lower risk of hypoglycemia: Insulin glargine and detemir have a lower risk of causing hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) compared to NPH insulin, especially during the night.\n3. More flexible dosing: Insulin glargine and detemir can be administered at any time of the day, whereas NPH insulin is typically administered in the morning or evening.\n4. Less weight gain: Insulin glargine and detemir are associated with less weight gain compared to NPH insulin.\n5. More convenient: Insulin glargine and detemir are available in prefilled pens, making them easier to administer and more convenient than NPH insulin, which requires a vial and syringe.\nHowever, it's important to note that the choice between insulin glargine, detemir, and NPH insulin depends on individual patient factors, such as lifestyle, blood sugar control, and other health conditions.

            "gold_answer": "For adults with AF undergoing catheter ablation, compared with uninterrupted anticoagulation, low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that those receiving interrupted anticoagulation (either completely or minimally interrupted) experienced a lower incidence of a composite endpoint (thromboembolic events, major bleeding, and all\u2010cause mortality) at three months (14 vs 59 per 1000 people; all results on average). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests little to no difference in major bleeding. Results on thromboembolic events, asymptomatic thromboembolic events, minor bleeding, or mortality alone were uncertain or imprecise. In subgroup analyses separately assessing completely and minimally interrupted anticoagulation, completely interrupted anticoagulation had a higher thromboembolic event rate (49 vs 3 per 1000 people), but the certainty of evidence was very low. Similarly, in a subgroup analysis using a fixed\u2010effect meta\u2010analytic model, rates of thromboembolic events were estimated at 15 versus 3 per 1000 people, again with very low\u2010certainty evidence.",

            "llm_answer": "Interrupted and uninterrupted anticoagulation for catheter ablation in adults with atrial fibrillation (AF) have been compared in several studies. Interrupted anticoagulation involves temporarily stopping anticoagulation therapy before and after the procedure, while uninterrupted anticoagulation involves continuing anticoagulation therapy throughout the procedure.\nA meta-analysis of 11 studies found that uninterrupted anticoagulation was associated with a lower risk of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) compared to interrupted anticoagulation (odds ratio 0.47, 95% CI 0.27-0.83). However, uninterrupted anticoagulation was also associated with a higher risk of bleeding complications (odds ratio 1.45, 95% CI 1.06-1.98).\nAnother study found that uninterrupted anticoagulation was associated with a lower risk of stroke or TIA at 1 year follow-up (2.4% vs 4.9%, p=0.047), but the risk of major bleeding was similar between the two groups (2.4% vs 3.2%, p=0.47).\nOverall, the evidence suggests that uninterrupted anticoagulation may be associated with a lower risk of stroke or TIA, but a higher risk of bleeding complications, compared to interrupted anticoagulation for catheter ablation in adults with AF. The choice between the two strategies should be individualized, taking into account the patient's risk factors, medical history, and other factors.",

            "gold_answer": "For adults with AF undergoing catheter ablation, compared with uninterrupted anticoagulation, low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that those receiving interrupted anticoagulation (either completely or minimally interrupted) experienced a lower incidence of a composite endpoint (thromboembolic events, major bleeding, and all\u2010cause mortality) at three months (14 vs 59 per 1000 people; all results on average). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests little to no difference in major bleeding. Results on thromboembolic events, asymptomatic thromboembolic events, minor bleeding, or mortality alone were uncertain or imprecise. In subgroup analyses separately assessing completely and minimally interrupted anticoagulation, completely interrupted anticoagulation had a higher thromboembolic event rate (49 vs 3 per 1000 people), but the certainty of evidence was very low. Similarly, in a subgroup analysis using a fixed\u2010effect meta\u2010analytic model, rates of thromboembolic events were estimated at 15 versus 3 per 1000 people, again with very low\u2010certainty evidence.",

Interrupted anticoagulation involves temporarily stopping the anticoagulation medication before and during the procedure, while uninterrupted anticoagulation involves continuing the medication throughout the procedure.\nA study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology found that uninterrupted anticoagulation was associated with a lower risk of bleeding complications compared to interrupted anticoagulation in patients undergoing catheter ablation for AF. The study found that the rate of bleeding complications was 2.4% in the uninterrupted anticoagulation group and 5.5% in the interrupted anticoagulation group.\nAnother study published in the European Heart Journal found that uninterrupted anticoagulation was associated with a higher rate of pulmonary vein reconnection after catheter ablation for AF, but the overall success rate of the procedure was not significantly different between the two groups.\nIt's important to note that both studies had a relatively small sample size and the results may not be generalizable to all patients with AF. Additionally, the choice of anticoagulation strategy during catheter ablation should be individualized based on various factors, such as the patient's medical history, clinical status, and the operator's experience.\nIn summary, the available evidence suggests that uninterrupted anticoagulation may be associated with a lower risk of bleeding complications during catheter ablation for AF, but may also be associated with a higher risk of pulmonary vein reconnection. The choice of anticoagulation strategy should be carefully considered and individualized for each patient.",

Withdrawals from treatment were few and likely to be similar for active and sham tDCS (moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Analyses for other outcomes were underpowered or the results were imprecise (change in activities of daily living scores, lower extremity function endpoint scores, change in upper extremity function scores, change in muscle strength scores, cognitive abilities, hemispatial neglect).",

Improved motor function: tDCS has been shown to improve motor function in patients with stroke by increasing the excitability of the affected motor cortex.\n2. Enhanced neural plasticity: tDCS has been found to promote neural plasticity by increasing the expression of plasticity-related genes and proteins, such as BDNF.\n3. Reduced spasticity: tDCS has been found to reduce spasticity in patients with stroke by decreasing the activity of the corticospinal tract.\n4. Improved cognitive function: tDCS has been found to improve cognitive function in patients with stroke, particularly in attention, memory, and executive function.\n5. Enhanced neural repair: tDCS has been found to promote neural repair by increasing the expression of growth factors and neurotrophins, such as BDNF and NT-3.\n6. Reduced fatigue: tDCS has been found to reduce fatigue in patients with stroke by increasing the activity of the anterior cingulate cortex.\n7. Improved mood: tDCS has been found to improve mood in patients with stroke, particularly in patients with depression.\nIt is important to note that the effects of tDCS can vary depending on the duration, intensity, and location of stimulation, as well as the individual patient's response. Further research is needed to fully understand the effects of tDCS on stroke recovery.",

Withdrawals from treatment were few and likely to be similar for active and sham tDCS (moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Analyses for other outcomes were underpowered or the results were imprecise (change in activities of daily living scores, lower extremity function endpoint scores, change in upper extremity function scores, change in muscle strength scores, cognitive abilities, hemispatial neglect).",

Some studies have suggested that tDCS may have several beneficial effects on stroke recovery, including:\n1. Improved motor function: tDCS has been shown to improve motor function in patients with stroke by increasing the excitability of the affected motor cortex.\n2. Enhanced neural plasticity: tDCS may promote neural plasticity by increasing the release of neurotrophic factors and enhancing the expression of genes involved in synaptic plasticity.\n3. Reduced spasticity: tDCS has been found to reduce spasticity in patients with stroke, which can improve motor function and reduce the risk of complications.\n4. Improved cognitive function: tDCS has been shown to improve cognitive function in patients with stroke, particularly in areas such as attention, memory, and executive function.\n5. Enhanced neural repair: tDCS may promote neural repair by increasing the expression of genes involved in neurogenesis and synaptogenesis.\nIt is important to note that the effects of tDCS on stroke recovery can vary depending on the individual, the severity of the stroke, and the timing and duration of the intervention. Additionally, tDCS is typically used in combination with other rehabilitation techniques, such as physical therapy and occupational therapy, to maximize its effectiveness.\nIt is important to consult with a healthcare professional before undergoing tDCS therapy, as it may not be suitable for everyone and proper training and equipment are necessary to ensure safe and effective treatment.",

However, reviewers rated evidence for these outcomes as low to very low certainty. Evidence for other efficacy outcomes (time undertaking moderate to vigorous physical activity; step count; body mass index; waist circumference; blood pressure) was based on small participant numbers (54 to 200). Low\u2010 and moderate\u2010certainty evidence suggests little to no difference between groups in incidence of falls and adverse events other than falls, respectively.

However, reviewers rated evidence for these outcomes as low to very low certainty. Evidence for other efficacy outcomes (time undertaking moderate to vigorous physical activity; step count; body mass index; waist circumference; blood pressure) was based on small participant numbers (54 to 200). Low\u2010 and moderate\u2010certainty evidence suggests little to no difference between groups in incidence of falls and adverse events other than falls, respectively. Given the paucity of available evidence, firm conclusions cannot be drawn.",

Some of the effects of interventions to reduce sedentary behavior in this population include:\n1. Improved physical function: Reducing sedentary behavior can help improve physical function and mobility, which can make it easier to perform daily activities and reduce the risk of falls.\n2. Increased physical activity: Engaging in physical activity can help improve cardiovascular health, reduce muscle weakness, and improve balance and coordination.\n3. Weight management: Reducing sedentary behavior can help with weight management, which can reduce the risk of complications such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease.\n4. Improved mental health: Reducing sedentary behavior can help reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety, which are common after a stroke.\n5. Better cognitive function: Engaging in physical activity has been shown to improve cognitive function and reduce the risk of dementia.\n6. Improved quality of life: Reducing sedentary behavior can improve overall quality of life and increase participation in activities that are important to the individual.\nIt's important to note that any intervention to reduce sedentary behavior should be tailored to the individual's abilities and limitations, and should be done under the guidance of a healthcare professional.",

Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests little to no benefit or harm of shunting on all\u2010cause mortality, stroke\u2010related mortality, stroke during surgery or up to 30 days postsurgery, and the composite outcome stroke or death. Although there may be a benefit on stroke within 24 hours (on average, 15 vs 92 per 1000 people experienced a stroke), this does not persist 30 days postsurgery. Evidence on cognitive function, wound hemorrhage or infection, and nerve palsy was either very limited or very uncertain. Of note, one RCT (69% of the review's population) used artery rather than participants as the unit of randomization/analysis.",

Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests little to no benefit or harm of shunting on all\u2010cause mortality, stroke\u2010related mortality, stroke during surgery or up to 30 days postsurgery, and the composite outcome stroke or death. Although there may be a benefit on stroke within 24 hours (on average, 15 vs 92 per 1000 people experienced a stroke), this does not persist 30 days postsurgery. Evidence on cognitive function, wound hemorrhage or infection, and nerve palsy was either very limited or very uncertain. Of note, one RCT (69% of the review's population) used artery rather than participants as the unit of randomization/analysis.",

            "llm_answer": "Carotid artery shunting is a procedure that is sometimes performed during carotid endarterectomy, which is a surgery to remove plaque from the carotid arteries in the neck. The benefits of routine carotid artery shunting for adults undergoing carotid endarterectomy include:\n* Reduced risk of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA or \"mini-stroke\") during the surgery, as the shunt helps to maintain blood flow to the brain.\n* Reduced risk of cognitive decline or memory loss after the surgery, as the shunt helps to prevent interruption of blood flow to the brain.\n* Shorter recovery time, as the shunt allows the surgeon to perform the surgery without interrupting blood flow to the brain.\nHowever, there are also potential harms associated with routine carotid artery shunting, including:\n* Increased risk of bleeding or hematoma at the site where the shunt is placed.\n* Increased risk of infection or sepsis, as the shunt provides a potential entry point for bacteria to enter the bloodstream.\n* Increased risk of stroke or TIA if the shunt becomes dislodged or occluded.\n* Increased risk of carotid artery damage or stenosis (narrowing) at the site where the shunt is placed.\nIt's important to note that the decision to perform a carotid artery shunt during carotid endarterectomy should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the individual patient's medical history, current health status, and surgical risks.

Moderate\u2010quality evidence showed that this benefit was not sustained in the longer\u2010term (5 years). Low\u2010quality evidence suggests there was no benefit of an adjunctive corticosteroid in terms of reducing rates of disabling neurological deficit, ether within 24 months or at 5 years. There was no apparent impact of adjunctive corticosteroids on the incidences of hepatitis, hyperglycemia/glycosuria, gastrointestinal bleeding, or invasive bacterial infection but event rates were very low meaning conclusions cannot be drawn.",

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers found no conclusive RCT evidence suggesting that administration of probiotics to pregnant women was superior or inferior to placebo in reducing morbidity or mortality in preterm infants. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that in pregnant women who received probiotics, the risk of preterm birth (< 37 weeks) and miscarriage/stillbirth was no more or less likely compared with those who did not receive probiotics. Only one RCT (159 infants) reported no incidences of early neonatal sepsis (\u2264 3 days) in either trial arm. For most outcomes, event rates were very low or there were no events in both arms. There is a lack of data on neonatal short\u2010term (early or late sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, neonatal death, hospital stay) and long\u2010term (major neurodevelopmental disability) potential benefits or harms following probiotic administration. None of the trials included women with a previous history of preterm birth, multiple pregnancy, or uterine anomaly. Reviewers did not assess serious adverse maternal or neonatal adverse events following use of probiotics.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "RCT (rct): A study which tests the effectiveness and safety of treatments or procedures as fairly and objectively as possible. By randomly assigning patients to different treatments for the same problem, the results can be assessed equally with the aim of discovering the best possible procedure for the condition.\nPLACEBO (placebo): an inactive substance; a pill/liquid that contains no medicine\nMORBIDITY (morbidity): undesired result or complication\nMORTALITY (mortality): death\nRISK (risk): The chance that an activity or hazard will give rise to harm. Risk is generally given in terms of numerical odds (1 in 10) or percentages (10%).\nSEPSIS (sepsis): The immune system's overreaction to an infection or injury which can lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and death.\nPOTENTIAL (potential): possible\nPOTENTIATE (potentiate): increase or multiply the effect of a drug or toxin (poison) by giving another drug or toxin at the same time (sometimes an unintentional result)\nPOTENTIATOR (potentiator): an agent that helps another agent work better\nASSESS (assess): to learn about, measure, evaluate, look at",

            "llm_answer": "Yes, probiotics administered to pregnant women have been shown to help prevent morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that can help maintain a healthy gut microbiome, which is important for the development and function of various bodily systems, including the immune system.\nStudies have found that probiotics can help reduce the risk of preterm birth, which is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Probiotics have also been shown to reduce the risk of other complications in preterm infants, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious condition that can cause damage to the intestines.\nIt's important to note that not all probiotics are the same, and some strains have been found to be more effective than others in preventing morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. For example, the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any supplements during pregnancy, including probiotics, to ensure safety and effectiveness. Additionally, it's important to note that while probiotics can help reduce the risk of complications, they are not a guarantee against them, and other factors such as proper prenatal care, a healthy diet, and a safe delivery are also important for a healthy pregnancy and baby.",
