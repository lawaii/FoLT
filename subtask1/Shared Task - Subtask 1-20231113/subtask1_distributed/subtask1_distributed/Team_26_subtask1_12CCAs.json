            "llm_answer": "I am not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on the topic. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is given before surgery to shrink the tumor and improve surgical outcomes. Capecitabine is a chemotherapy drug that is sometimes used in neoadjuvant regimens for breast cancer.\nThere have been studies comparing neoadjuvant regimens containing capecitabine to those that do not contain capecitabine in the treatment of localized/invasive breast cancer. A systematic review and meta-analysis published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in 2018 found that neoadjuvant regimens containing capecitabine were associated with higher rates of pathological complete response (pCR) compared to non-capecitabine regimens. pCR is defined as the absence of any residual cancer cells in the breast or lymph nodes after treatment.\nHowever, it's important to note that the choice of neoadjuvant regimen depends on various factors, including the type and stage of breast cancer, patient age and overall health, and other individual factors. It's important for patients to discuss their treatment options with their oncologist and develop a personalized plan that is right for them.\nIt's also worth noting that while capecitabine may have benefits in terms of pCR, it can also have side effects, such as hand-foot syndrome, diarrhea, and fatigue. Patients should discuss the potential benefits and risks of capecitabine with their healthcare provider to determine if it's the right choice for them.\nIn summary, while capecitabine-containing regimens may have a higher rate of pCR compared to non-capecitabine regimens, the choice of neoadjuvant regimen should be individualized and take into account various factors, including the patient's overall health and treatment goals.",

Convenience: Telerehabilitation can be conducted from the comfort of the individual's own home, reducing the need for travel time and allowing for greater flexibility in scheduling.\n4. Personalized care: Telerehabilitation can provide personalized care and attention to individuals with COPD, as healthcare professionals can monitor their progress and adjust their treatment plans remotely.\n5. Reduced hospitalizations: Telerehabilitation can help reduce hospitalizations for adults with COPD by providing them with the tools and resources they need to manage their condition effectively.\n6. Improved quality of life: Telerehabilitation can improve the overall quality of life for adults with COPD by helping them manage their symptoms, increase their physical activity levels, and reduce their feelings of anxiety and depression.\nIt is important to note that while telerehabilitation can be an effective tool for managing COPD, it should be used in conjunction with in-person care and under the guidance of a healthcare professional.",

            "llm_answer": "A levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) is a type of intrauterine device (IUD) that releases a low dose of progesterone into the uterus to prevent pregnancy. It is a popular option for women with fibroids, as it can help reduce menstrual bleeding and pain associated with the condition.\nCompared to low-dose combined oral contraceptive (COC) or oral norethisterone acetate (NETA), LNG-IUS has several advantages for women with fibroids:\n1. Reduced menstrual bleeding: LNG-IUS can significantly reduce menstrual bleeding, which can be particularly beneficial for women with fibroids who often experience heavy and prolonged periods. COCs and NETA may also reduce menstrual bleeding, but the effect may not be as pronounced as with LNG-IUS.\n2. Reduced pain: LNG-IUS can also reduce pain associated with fibroids, such as cramping and pelvic pain, which can improve quality of life for women with the condition.\n3. Fewer side effects: LNG-IUS has fewer side effects compared to COCs and NETA, which can cause nausea, breast tenderness, and mood changes.\n4. Long-term use: LNG-IUS can be used for long periods of time, up to 5 years, making it a convenient and effective option for women with fibroids who require ongoing treatment.\n5. Reversible: LNG-IUS is a reversible form of contraception, meaning that fertility returns quickly after removal of the device.\nHowever, it's important to note that LNG-IUS may not be suitable for all women with fibroids, particularly those with larger fibroids or those who have a history of pelvic inflammatory disease. It's essential to discuss the best treatment options with a healthcare provider, who can assess individual circumstances and provide personalized advice.",

            "gold_answer": "Surfactant administration via thin catheter is more effective than surfactant administration through an endotracheal tube, although the applicability of results across different populations is uncertain, as trials were conducted in only a small group of neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in China, India, Iran, Pakistan, and Turkey. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that compared with infants who received S\u2010ETT, fewer infants who received S\u2010TC died or developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age (159 vs 269 per 1000 infants; all results on average). Assessment of BPD alone among survivors at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age also favored S\u2010TC (99 vs 173 per 1000 infants), and S\u2010TC reduced the need for intubation within the first 72 hours of life (252 vs 400 per 1000 infants). Similar improvements were seen in other outcomes for infants who received S\u2010TC, including reduction in severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH; 43 vs 68 per 1000 infants) and death from any cause during first hospitalization (61 vs 97 per 1000 infants), as well as a trend toward fewer air leaks requiring drainage during first hospitalization (although the difference between groups did not reach statistical significance); however, the certainty of evidence for these outcomes is low, and these findings should be interpreted with caution. There were no clear differences between groups for other outcomes, including unsuccessful catheter or ETT placement at first attempt (from 6 RCTs with 776 infants), bradycardia (heart rate < 100 bpm) during the intervention (from 5 RCTs with 650 infants), and hypoxemia (oxygen saturation < 80%) during the intervention (from 4 RCTs with 553 infants). No studies assessed the composite outcome of death or survival with neurosensory disability. Included studies were conducted in China, India, Iran, Pakistan, and Turkey, and it is unclear to what extent these findings are applicable to other NICU settings with different monitoring and care capacity.",

However, S-TC has been shown to have several advantages over S-ETT, including:\n* Faster administration time: S-TC delivers surfactant more quickly than S-ETT, which can be beneficial in emergency situations.\n* Lower risk of airway obstruction: S-TC reduces the risk of airway obstruction compared to S-ETT, which can occur when the endotracheal tube blocks the airway.\n* Fewer complications: S-TC has been associated with fewer complications, such as pneumothorax, pneumonia, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, compared to S-ETT.\n* Improved lung recruitment: S-TC may improve lung recruitment and reduce the need for mechanical ventilation, which can lead to better outcomes for preterm infants.\nOverall, S-TC appears to be a safer and more effective method for delivering surfactant to preterm infants with or at risk of respiratory distress syndrome compared to S-ETT. However, the choice of administration method may depend on various factors, such as the infant's gestational age, birth weight, and clinical condition.",

            "gold_answer": "Surfactant administration via thin catheter is more effective than surfactant administration through an endotracheal tube, although the applicability of results across different populations is uncertain, as trials were conducted in only a small group of neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in China, India, Iran, Pakistan, and Turkey. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that compared with infants who received S\u2010ETT, fewer infants who received S\u2010TC died or developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age (159 vs 269 per 1000 infants; all results on average). Assessment of BPD alone among survivors at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age also favored S\u2010TC (99 vs 173 per 1000 infants), and S\u2010TC reduced the need for intubation within the first 72 hours of life (252 vs 400 per 1000 infants). Similar improvements were seen in other outcomes for infants who received S\u2010TC, including reduction in severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH; 43 vs 68 per 1000 infants) and death from any cause during first hospitalization (61 vs 97 per 1000 infants), as well as a trend toward fewer air leaks requiring drainage during first hospitalization (although the difference between groups did not reach statistical significance); however, the certainty of evidence for these outcomes is low, and these findings should be interpreted with caution. There were no clear differences between groups for other outcomes, including unsuccessful catheter or ETT placement at first attempt (from 6 RCTs with 776 infants), bradycardia (heart rate < 100 bpm) during the intervention (from 5 RCTs with 650 infants), and hypoxemia (oxygen saturation < 80%) during the intervention (from 4 RCTs with 553 infants). No studies assessed the composite outcome of death or survival with neurosensory disability. Included studies were conducted in China, India, Iran, Pakistan, and Turkey, and it is unclear to what extent these findings are applicable to other NICU settings with different monitoring and care capacity.",

            "llm_answer": "Surfactant administration via thin catheter (S-TC) and surfactant administration through an endotracheal tube (S-ETT) are both common methods used to deliver surfactant to preterm infants with or at risk of respiratory distress syndrome. While both methods have been shown to be effective in improving respiratory outcomes for preterm infants, there are some differences between the two.\nS-TC involves administering surfactant through a thin catheter inserted through the nose or mouth and guided through the airways to the lungs. This method has been shown to be less invasive and associated with fewer complications compared to S-ETT, which involves inserting a tube through the mouth or nose and into the trachea.\nOne study published in the Journal of Pediatrics found that S-TC was associated with a lower risk of air leak and pneumothorax compared to S-ETT. Additionally, S-TC was found to be more effective in reducing the need for mechanical ventilation and improving oxygenation in preterm infants.\nHowever, it's important to note that S-TC may not be suitable for all preterm infants, especially those with more severe respiratory distress syndrome. In these cases, S-ETT may be more effective in delivering the surfactant directly to the lungs.\nUltimately, the choice between S-TC and S-ETT will depend on various factors, including the infant's gestational age, birth weight, and severity of respiratory distress syndrome. It's important for healthcare providers to carefully evaluate each infant's individual needs and make an informed decision based on the latest medical evidence.",

            "gold_answer": "In adults with early gastric cancer, distal gastrectomy followed by Roux\u2010en\u2010Y reconstruction may reduce the incidence of bile reflux in comparison to Billroth\u2010I reconstruction. However, reconstruction with Roux\u2010en\u2010Y may also lead to increased postoperative morbidity and hospital stay duration. In adults with early gastric cancer who underwent distal gastrectomy, moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows a probably lower incidence of bile reflux with reconstruction with Roux\u2010en\u2010Y compared with Billroth\u2010I (195 vs 490 per 1000 people; all results on average). However, very low\u2010certainty evidence suggests a longer duration of hospital stay with Roux\u2010en\u2010Y surgery (around 1 day more). Postoperative morbidity was also reduced with Billroth\u2010I (86 per 1000 people) compared with Roux\u2010en\u2010Y (126 per 1000 people; low\u2010certainty evidence). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests no significant difference in health\u2010related quality of life among the two groups of people. Similarly, there was no clear difference in the incidence of anastomotic leaks and weight loss between the two groups (very low\u2010 to low\u2010certainty evidence).",

            "llm_answer": "Roux-en-Y reconstruction and Billroth-I reconstruction are both common methods used after distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer. While both methods have their advantages and disadvantages, Roux-en-Y reconstruction is generally considered to have better outcomes in terms of postoperative complications, nutritional status, and quality of life.\nRoux-en-Y reconstruction involves creating a jejuno-jejunostomy (a connection between two parts of the small intestine) and a gastro-jejunostomy (a connection between the stomach and small intestine), which allows for a more normal digestive process. Billroth-I reconstruction, on the other hand, involves creating a gastro-jejunostomy only, which can result in a higher risk of postoperative complications such as anastomotic leakage and stricture.\nAdditionally, Roux-en-Y reconstruction has been shown to have better nutritional outcomes, as it allows for a greater surface area for nutrient absorption and reduces the risk of malnutrition. Patients who undergo Roux-en-Y reconstruction also tend to have better quality of life outcomes, with fewer symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.\nOverall, while both methods have their advantages and disadvantages, Roux-en-Y reconstruction is generally considered the preferred method after distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer, as it is associated with fewer postoperative complications, better nutritional outcomes, and improved quality of life.",

            "gold_answer": "In adults with early gastric cancer, distal gastrectomy followed by Roux\u2010en\u2010Y reconstruction may reduce the incidence of bile reflux in comparison to Billroth\u2010I reconstruction. However, reconstruction with Roux\u2010en\u2010Y may also lead to increased postoperative morbidity and hospital stay duration. In adults with early gastric cancer who underwent distal gastrectomy, moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows a probably lower incidence of bile reflux with reconstruction with Roux\u2010en\u2010Y compared with Billroth\u2010I (195 vs 490 per 1000 people; all results on average). However, very low\u2010certainty evidence suggests a longer duration of hospital stay with Roux\u2010en\u2010Y surgery (around 1 day more). Postoperative morbidity was also reduced with Billroth\u2010I (86 per 1000 people) compared with Roux\u2010en\u2010Y (126 per 1000 people; low\u2010certainty evidence). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests no significant difference in health\u2010related quality of life among the two groups of people. Similarly, there was no clear difference in the incidence of anastomotic leaks and weight loss between the two groups (very low\u2010 to low\u2010certainty evidence).",

            "llm_answer": "Roux-en-Y reconstruction and Billroth-I reconstruction are both surgical techniques used after distal gastrectomy, a surgery to remove a portion of the stomach, usually for treatment of gastric cancer. The main difference between the two techniques is the way the surgeon reconnects the remaining stomach to the small intestine.\nRoux-en-Y reconstruction involves creating a Y-shaped connection between the stomach and small intestine, allowing food to flow directly from the stomach into the small intestine. This technique is often preferred for patients who have a high risk of developing dumping syndrome, a condition where food moves too quickly through the small intestine, causing symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.\nBillroth-I reconstruction, on the other hand, involves reconnecting the stomach to the small intestine in a side-to-side fashion, creating a blind pouch that does not allow food to flow directly into the small intestine. This technique is often preferred for patients who have a lower risk of developing dumping syndrome.\nIn terms of outcomes, both techniques have been shown to be effective in treating gastric cancer, with similar survival rates and recurrence rates. However, Roux-en-Y reconstruction may have a slightly higher risk of complications such as anastomotic leakage and stricture, while Billroth-I reconstruction may have a slightly higher risk of delayed gastric emptying.\nUltimately, the choice between Roux-en-Y and Billroth-I reconstruction depends on various factors, including the patient's individual needs, the surgeon's experience and preference, and the specific type and stage of gastric cancer being treated. It's important for patients to discuss the pros and cons of each technique with their surgeon and make an informed decision based on their individual circumstances.",

Little to no difference between groups was reported as well for rates of mortality at 6 months and for incidences of lower limb thrombosis and major bleeding at 90 days (moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Filter thrombosis was detected in 6 of 122 people (5%) in one study, and one person in this study required surgical removal.

However, the use of vena caval filters alone, without anticoagulation therapy, is not recommended for preventing PE in this population.\nA systematic review and meta-analysis published in the Journal of the American College of Surgeons found that the use of vena caval filters in trauma patients with multiple injuries reduced the risk of PE by 77% compared to anticoagulation therapy alone. However, the use of vena caval filters was associated with a higher risk of bleeding complications, including major bleeding and bleeding-related mortality.\nThe American College of Chest Physicians recommends that vena caval filters be used in trauma patients with multiple injuries who have a high risk of PE and who cannot receive anticoagulation therapy due to bleeding risk or other contraindications. However, the guidelines emphasize that vena caval filters should be used in conjunction with anticoagulation therapy, rather than as a substitute for it.\nIn summary, while vena caval filters can be an effective adjunct to anticoagulation therapy in reducing the risk of PE in adults who have sustained multiple traumatic injuries, they should not be used alone without anticoagulation therapy due to the risk of bleeding complications.

However, their safety profile is not well established, and their use is not without controversy.\nSome studies have suggested that HIF stabilizers may increase the risk of blood clots, hypertension, and cardiovascular events in patients with CKD. Additionally, there is concern that these drugs may worsen kidney function in some patients.\nAs a result, the use of HIF stabilizers for the treatment of anemia in CKD is generally recommended only for patients who have a hemoglobin level below 10 g/dL and who have not responded to other treatments, such as iron supplementation and blood transfusions.\nIt's important to note that the decision to initiate HIF stabilizer therapy should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the patient's individual risks and benefits. Regular monitoring of blood pressure, kidney function, and blood counts is crucial to ensure that the drug is not causing harm.\nIn summary, while HIF stabilizers can be effective in treating anemia of CKD, their safety profile is not well established, and their use should be carefully considered and closely monitored.",

            "gold_answer": "High\u2010certainty evidence shows that compared with placebo, fewer people who received WIBP\u2010CorV (Sinopharm WIBP), BBIBP\u2010CorV (Sinopharm BBIBP), or BBV152 (Bharat Biotech) had confirmed SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection (584, 670, and 1266 fewer cases per 100,000 people, respectively; all results on average); fewer people had confirmed symptomatic COVID\u201019 with the same vaccines (543, 583, and 970 fewer cases per 100,000 people, respectively); and fewer people developed severe or critical COVID\u201019 with BBV152 (164 fewer cases per 100,000 people). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that fewer participants experienced confirmed symptomatic COVID\u201019 (1674 fewer cases per 100,000 people) and severe or critical disease with CoronaVac compared with placebo. There was little to no difference in all\u2010cause mortality between CoronaVac or BBV152 and placebo (low\u2010certainty evidence). High\u2010certainty evidence shows a small increase in systemic reactogenicity events with BBV152 (6 more cases per 1000 people), and based on high\u2010 and moderate\u2010certainty evidence, there was little to no difference for this outcome between WIBP\u2010CorV or BBIBP\u2010CorV and placebo, respectively. Regarding adverse events, high\u2010certainty evidence shows an increase in adverse events with CoronaVac (48 more cases per 1000 people); a reduced number of adverse events with WIBP\u2010CorV (20 fewer cases per 1000 people); and little to no difference between groups with BBV152 compared with placebo. Furthermore, high\u2010certainty evidence shows an increase in local reactogenicity events with CoronaVac (173 more cases per 1000 people); a reduced number of events with WIBP\u2010CorV (35 fewer cases per 1000 people); and little to no difference between groups with BBV152 compared with placebo. There were mixed effects of BBIBP\u2010CorV on any and local reactogenicity events among different trials (low\u2010certainty evidence). High\u2010certainty evidence shows a lower risk of serious adverse events with BBV152 than with placebo (162 fewer cases per 100,000 people), and low\u2010certainty evidence suggests little to no difference between the other inactivated virus vaccines for preventing COVID\u201019 and placebo.",

Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that fewer participants experienced confirmed symptomatic COVID\u201019 (1674 fewer cases per 100,000 people) and severe or critical disease with CoronaVac compared with placebo. There was little to no difference in all\u2010cause mortality between CoronaVac or BBV152 and placebo (low\u2010certainty evidence). High\u2010certainty evidence shows a small increase in systemic reactogenicity events with BBV152 (6 more cases per 1000 people), and based on high\u2010 and moderate\u2010certainty evidence, there was little to no difference for this outcome between WIBP\u2010CorV or BBIBP\u2010CorV and placebo, respectively. Regarding adverse events, high\u2010certainty evidence shows an increase in adverse events with CoronaVac (48 more cases per 1000 people); a reduced number of adverse events with WIBP\u2010CorV (20 fewer cases per 1000 people); and little to no difference between groups with BBV152 compared with placebo. Furthermore, high\u2010certainty evidence shows an increase in local reactogenicity events with CoronaVac (173 more cases per 1000 people); a reduced number of events with WIBP\u2010CorV (35 fewer cases per 1000 people); and little to no difference between groups with BBV152 compared with placebo. There were mixed effects of BBIBP\u2010CorV on any and local reactogenicity events among different trials (low\u2010certainty evidence). High\u2010certainty evidence shows a lower risk of serious adverse events with BBV152 than with placebo (162 fewer cases per 100,000 people), and low\u2010certainty evidence suggests little to no difference between the other inactivated virus vaccines for preventing COVID\u201019 and placebo.",

They may not protect against future variants of the virus.\n3. They can cause mild side effects, such as pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site, fever, fatigue, headache, and muscle or joint pain.\n4. They may not be effective in people who have already been infected with COVID-19 or have been exposed to the virus.\nIt's important to keep in mind that the benefits of inactivated virus vaccines in preventing severe illness and hospitalization due to COVID-19 far outweigh the risks.

IV iron is directly delivered to the bloodstream, bypassing the gut, which may be inflamed and less able to absorb iron effectively. IV iron has been shown to produce faster and more sustained increases in hemoglobin levels compared to oral iron. However, oral iron may still be effective in some patients, particularly those with mild to moderate iron deficiency anemia, and may be preferred in patients who cannot receive IV iron or who have a history of IV iron reactions. Ultimately, the choice between IV and oral iron should be individualized and guided by a healthcare provider, taking into account the patient's medical history, disease severity, and other factors.",

            "llm_answer": "For people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), both intravenous (IV) and oral iron preparations can be effective for treating iron deficiency anemia. However, the choice between the two may depend on several factors, including the severity of the anemia, the patient's overall health status, and the presence of any comorbidities.\nIV iron preparations, such as ferric gluconate or iron sucrose, are generally better tolerated and may be more effective in patients with severe iron deficiency anemia or those who have had a poor response to oral iron supplements. IV iron can also be administered more quickly and may be better suited for patients who have difficulty taking oral medications or who have gastrointestinal symptoms that may interfere with oral iron absorption.\nOral iron preparations, such as ferrous sulfate or ferrous gluconate, can be effective for mild to moderate iron deficiency anemia and may be more convenient for patients who can take medications by mouth. However, oral iron can be associated with gastrointestinal side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, and may interact with other medications.\nIt's important to note that the choice between IV and oral iron preparations should be made on an individual basis, in consultation with a healthcare provider, who can assess the patient's specific needs and medical history. Additionally, it's important to monitor iron levels and hemoglobin levels regularly to ensure that the treatment is effective and to avoid iron overload, which can be harmful.",

            "gold_answer": "Vitamin A given to children six months to five years of age from low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries appears to reduce rates of diarrhea, night blindness, measles, and malaria, as well as overall mortality and mortality from diarrhea\u2010related illnesses, with an average of 1 to 3 fewer events per 1000 children, although 30 more children per 1000 experienced vomiting within 48 hours of ingestion. High\u2010certainty evidence shows that all\u2010cause mortality and mortality from diarrhea were lower among children aged six months to five years who received vitamin A supplementation (mostly single doses of 50,000 to 200,000 IU, depending on age) than in children who received no vitamin A (all\u2010cause mortality: 23 vs 26 per 1000 children; mortality from diarrhea: 7 vs 8 per 1000 children; all results on average). RCTs reported little to no differences between groups in mortality due to measles, meningitis, or lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs); however, the certainty of the evidence for these outcomes was low. RCTs reported that fewer children receiving vitamin A developed diarrhea (on average, 1 vs 4 episodes/child; low\u2010certainty evidence); measles (0.1 vs 0.2 episodes/child/year; moderate\u2010 certainty evidence); malaria (2 vs 3 per 1000 children; certainty of evidence not reported); Bitot's spots (15 vs 35 per 1000 children; moderate\u2010certainty evidence); or night blindness (1 vs 4 per 1000 children; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Absorption of vitamin A was demonstrated in children receiving supplementation, as fewer children experienced vitamin A deficiency when compared with those who received no supplementation (361 vs 509 per 1000 children; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). RCTs showed little to no differences between groups in rates of xerophthalmia, LRTI, or hospitalization. More children who received vitamin A vomited within the first 48 hours of ingestion (61 vs 31 per 1000 children, moderate\u2010certainty evidence); RCTs reported little to no differences in bulging fontanelle and reported no other adverse effects.",

            "gold_answer": "Vitamin A given to children six months to five years of age from low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries appears to reduce rates of diarrhea, night blindness, measles, and malaria, as well as overall mortality and mortality from diarrhea\u2010related illnesses, with an average of 1 to 3 fewer events per 1000 children, although 30 more children per 1000 experienced vomiting within 48 hours of ingestion. High\u2010certainty evidence shows that all\u2010cause mortality and mortality from diarrhea were lower among children aged six months to five years who received vitamin A supplementation (mostly single doses of 50,000 to 200,000 IU, depending on age) than in children who received no vitamin A (all\u2010cause mortality: 23 vs 26 per 1000 children; mortality from diarrhea: 7 vs 8 per 1000 children; all results on average). RCTs reported little to no differences between groups in mortality due to measles, meningitis, or lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs); however, the certainty of the evidence for these outcomes was low. RCTs reported that fewer children receiving vitamin A developed diarrhea (on average, 1 vs 4 episodes/child; low\u2010certainty evidence); measles (0.1 vs 0.2 episodes/child/year; moderate\u2010 certainty evidence); malaria (2 vs 3 per 1000 children; certainty of evidence not reported); Bitot's spots (15 vs 35 per 1000 children; moderate\u2010certainty evidence); or night blindness (1 vs 4 per 1000 children; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Absorption of vitamin A was demonstrated in children receiving supplementation, as fewer children experienced vitamin A deficiency when compared with those who received no supplementation (361 vs 509 per 1000 children; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). RCTs showed little to no differences between groups in rates of xerophthalmia, LRTI, or hospitalization. More children who received vitamin A vomited within the first 48 hours of ingestion (61 vs 31 per 1000 children, moderate\u2010certainty evidence); RCTs reported little to no differences in bulging fontanelle and reported no other adverse effects.",

Prevention of Vitamin A Deficiency: Vitamin A is essential for healthy vision, immune function, and growth and development. Supplementing with vitamin A can prevent deficiency, which can cause conditions such as night blindness, dry skin, and impaired immune function.\n2. Reduced Risk of Infections: Vitamin A supplementation has been shown to reduce the risk of infections, such as diarrhea and respiratory infections, in young children.\n3. Improved Vision: Vitamin A is important for the development and maintenance of healthy vision, and supplementation can help to prevent vision problems, such as amblyopia (lazy eye) and strabismus (crossed eyes).\n4. Improved Growth and Development: Vitamin A is important for growth and development, and supplementation can help to ensure that children are getting enough of this essential nutrient.\nHarms:\n1. Excessive Intake: Taking too much vitamin A can be harmful, as it can cause toxicity. Children who take too much vitamin A may experience symptoms such as headaches, dizziness, and blurred vision.\n2. Interaction with Medications: Vitamin A can interact with certain medications, such as anticoagulants and chemotherapy drugs, and can increase the risk of bleeding.\n3. Allergic Reactions: Some children may be allergic to vitamin A supplements and may experience an allergic reaction, such as hives, itching, or difficulty breathing.\n4. Contamination Risk: Vitamin A supplements may be contaminated with harmful substances, such as heavy metals, which can be harmful to children's health.\nIt is important to consult with a healthcare professional before giving vitamin A supplements to children.

Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that can help maintain a healthy gut microbiome, which is important for the development and function of various bodily systems, including the immune system.\nStudies have found that probiotics can help reduce the risk of preterm birth, which is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Probiotics have also been shown to reduce the risk of other complications in preterm infants, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious condition that can cause damage to the intestines.\nIt's important to note that not all probiotics are the same, and some strains have been found to be more effective than others in preventing morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. For example, the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any supplements during pregnancy, including probiotics, to ensure safety and effectiveness. Additionally, it's important to note that while probiotics can help reduce the risk of complications, they are not a guarantee against them, and other factors such as proper prenatal care, a healthy diet, and a safe delivery are also important for a healthy pregnancy and baby.",
