            "gold_answer": "Evidence from RCTs shows some beneficial effects of the levonorgestrel\u2010releasing intrauterine system (LNG\u2010IUS) in women taking adjuvant tamoxifen for breast cancer, at the expense of increased risk of adverse effects. Adding LNG\u2010IUS to endometrial surveillance reduces the risk of developing benign endometrial polyps and endometrial hyperplasia at 24 to 60 months compared with surveillance alone (on average, 51 vs 194 per 1000 women and 3 vs 21 per 1000 women, respectively; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). However, moderate\u2010certainty evidence at 12 and 24 months of follow\u2010up shows that use of LNG\u2010IUS is also associated with an increased incidence of abnormal vaginal bleeding or spotting (on average, 113 vs 17 per 1000 women at 12 months and 83 vs 32 per 1000 at 24 months). Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows little to no difference between groups in terms of fibroid incidence, but results regarding breast cancer recurrence or breast cancer death were imprecise. No conclusions could be drawn on effects of the LNG\u2010IUS on the risk of developing endometrial cancer (the most dangerous adverse effect of tamoxifen use), as no events were observed in the two eligible studies.",

However, available data suggest that LNG-IUS may improve outcomes in these women by reducing the risk of endometrial cancer and bleeding, which are common side effects of tamoxifen. A 2017 Cochrane review found that LNG-IUS reduced the risk of endometrial cancer by 70% in women taking tamoxifen, and a 2020 systematic review found that LNG-IUS reduced the risk of bleeding by 50-70% in women taking tamoxifen. However, the evidence is not yet strong enough to support widespread use of LNG-IUS in this population, and further research is needed to confirm these findings and establish the long-term safety and efficacy of LNG-IUS in women taking adjuvant tamoxifen.",

            "llm_answer": "The levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) is a form of hormonal birth control that is sometimes used in women with breast cancer who are taking tamoxifen as adjuvant therapy. Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that works by blocking the effects of estrogen on cancer cells. However, it can also increase the risk of endometrial cancer, which is where the LNG-IUS comes in.\nThe LNG-IUS releases a low dose of progesterone directly into the uterus, which can help to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. Some studies have suggested that the use of LNG-IUS in women taking tamoxifen may improve outcomes by reducing the risk of endometrial cancer and possibly also improving breast cancer outcomes. However, the evidence is not yet definitive, and more research is needed to fully understand the benefits and risks of using LNG-IUS in this context.\nIt's important to note that the use of LNG-IUS in breast cancer treatment is still considered experimental and is not yet widely recommended. If you have breast cancer and are taking tamoxifen, it's important to discuss your individual risks and benefits with your healthcare provider. They can help you understand the potential risks and benefits of using LNG-IUS and make an informed decision about whether it's right for you.",

Studies have consistently shown that lowering blood pressure can help reduce the risk of developing diabetic retinopathy, and can also slow the progression of the disease in those who already have it. This is because high blood pressure can cause damage to the blood vessels in the retina, which can lead to vision loss and blindness.\nThe American Diabetes Association recommends that people with diabetes maintain a blood pressure level of less than 140/90 mmHg to reduce the risk of complications, including diabetic retinopathy. Additionally, the American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends that people with diabetes receive regular eye exams to monitor for diabetic retinopathy, and that those with high blood pressure or other risk factors receive more frequent exams.\nIt's important to note that while blood pressure control can help reduce the risk of diabetic retinopathy, it is not a guarantee that it will not develop. Other factors such as blood sugar control, cholesterol levels, and smoking status can also play a role in the development of the disease. It's important for people with diabetes to work closely with their healthcare provider to manage all of these factors and reduce their risk of complications.",

            "gold_answer": "When different methods of providing postnatal care at home for women in the early postpartum period were compared, the only difference detected in RCTs was that fewer women developed postnatal depression with a flexible home visiting schedule (individualized home visits extended beyond the usual period of care) than with a routine schedule (midwife visits confined to the early postpartum period) (on average, 143 vs 212 per 1000 women). However, all outcomes were assessed in single trials that evaluated different comparisons, and no RCTs assessed several clinically relevant outcomes (maternal mortality or morbidity, secondary postpartum hemorrhage, maternal satisfaction, neonatal respiratory tract infection, jaundice, diarrhea, failure to thrive, abuse/neglect, immunization). In addition, reviewers did not assess the quality of the evidence, but most trials failed to describe key methods or described methods that could introduce bias (such as failure to blind outcome assessors and high attrition rates). Therefore, conclusions of equivalence for the safety and efficacy of different methods of providing postnatal care at home in the early postpartum period cannot be drawn.",

However, the evidence suggests that home visits by trained healthcare professionals may be the most effective approach, particularly for women with high-risk pregnancies or those who experience complications during childbirth. Home visits can provide hands-on care and support, address concerns and questions, and facilitate early detection and treatment of complications. Phone calls and online support can also be useful, particularly for women who live in remote areas or have difficulty accessing in-person care. Ultimately, the choice of postnatal care method should be tailored to the individual woman's needs and preferences.",

            "gold_answer": "When different methods of providing postnatal care at home for women in the early postpartum period were compared, the only difference detected in RCTs was that fewer women developed postnatal depression with a flexible home visiting schedule (individualized home visits extended beyond the usual period of care) than with a routine schedule (midwife visits confined to the early postpartum period) (on average, 143 vs 212 per 1000 women). However, all outcomes were assessed in single trials that evaluated different comparisons, and no RCTs assessed several clinically relevant outcomes (maternal mortality or morbidity, secondary postpartum hemorrhage, maternal satisfaction, neonatal respiratory tract infection, jaundice, diarrhea, failure to thrive, abuse/neglect, immunization). In addition, reviewers did not assess the quality of the evidence, but most trials failed to describe key methods or described methods that could introduce bias (such as failure to blind outcome assessors and high attrition rates). Therefore, conclusions of equivalence for the safety and efficacy of different methods of providing postnatal care at home in the early postpartum period cannot be drawn.",

            "llm_answer": "There are several methods of providing postnatal care at home in the early postpartum period, and they can vary in terms of their effectiveness, safety, and suitability for different women. Here are some of the most common methods:\n1. Home visits by a healthcare provider: This involves a healthcare provider, such as a midwife or nurse, visiting the woman at home to provide check-ups, monitor her health and the baby's health, and provide guidance on breastfeeding, baby care, and other aspects of postnatal care. This method is often recommended for women who have had a low-risk pregnancy and delivery, and who do not have any underlying health conditions that require close monitoring.\n2. Home birth and postnatal care: Some women choose to give birth at home, either with the assistance of a midwife or without, and then receive postnatal care at home. This method is often preferred by women who want to avoid hospital interventions and who have a low-risk pregnancy. However, it's important to note that home birth carries a higher risk of complications, such as bleeding, infection, and neonatal distress, compared to hospital birth.\n3. Online postnatal care: With the rise of telemedicine, some healthcare providers are now offering online postnatal care, where women can have video consultations with a healthcare provider, receive guidance on breastfeeding and baby care, and monitor their health and the baby's health remotely. This method can be convenient for women who live in remote areas, have mobility issues, or prefer the comfort of their own home. However, it's important to ensure that the healthcare provider is licensed and qualified, and that the technology used is secure and reliable.\n4. Support groups: Joining a support group, either in-person or online, can provide women with a sense of community and connection with other new mothers. These groups can offer valuable advice, emotional support, and practical help with breastfeeding, baby care, and other aspects of postnatal care.\nIt's important to note that the most appropriate method of postnatal care will depend on individual circumstances, such as the woman's health, the baby's health, and her personal preferences",

Better cosmetic outcomes: O-BCS is designed to preserve the natural shape and appearance of the breast, resulting in better cosmetic outcomes compared to S-BCS or mastectomy.\n2. Lower risk of complications: O-BCS has been shown to have a lower risk of complications compared to mastectomy, such as lymphedema, nerve damage, and wound infections.\n3. Improved breast symmetry: O-BCS can help maintain breast symmetry, which is important for women who want to preserve their natural appearance.\n4. Reduced risk of recurrence: Studies have shown that O-BCS has a lower risk of cancer recurrence compared to S-BCS.\n5. Better quality of life: O-BCS has been associated with improved quality of life and better psychological outcomes for women with breast cancer.\nHowever, it's important to note that O-BCS may not be suitable for all women with primary breast cancer, and the decision to undergo O-BCS should be made on a case-by-case basis with the guidance of a qualified healthcare professional.

For IgG alone, average pooled sensitivity was 27.2% at 1 to 7 days, 64.8% at 8 to 14 days, 88.1% at 15 to 21 days, 92.6% at 22 to 28 days, and 93.5% at 29 to 35 days. Pooled sensitivities for IgM alone were 29.5%, 64.6%, 78.3%, 63.8%, and 59.8%, respectively. Pooled sensitivities for IgG or IgM were 41.1%, 74.9%, 88.0%, 91.3%, and 94.4%, respectively. At a prevalence of 2%, 8 (95% CI 5 to 15) people would be falsely positive and 2 (95% CI 2 to 3) would be missed, for every 1000 people undergoing IgG or IgM testing in week three after onset of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. The reviewers pooled specificities across all time points for each test; average specificity ranged from 98.6% for IgM to 99.8% for total antibodies. It is worth noting that all of the included studies were at high risk of bias for at least one of the four quality criteria assessed.",

            "gold_answer": "Using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) as the reference standard, in people with suspected or confirmed SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection, the reviewers reported the sensitivity of IgG and IgM antibody tests (alone or in combination) for detection of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection across five time points. For IgG alone, average pooled sensitivity was 27.2% at 1 to 7 days, 64.8% at 8 to 14 days, 88.1% at 15 to 21 days, 92.6% at 22 to 28 days, and 93.5% at 29 to 35 days. Pooled sensitivities for IgM alone were 29.5%, 64.6%, 78.3%, 63.8%, and 59.8%, respectively. Pooled sensitivities for IgG or IgM were 41.1%, 74.9%, 88.0%, 91.3%, and 94.4%, respectively. At a prevalence of 2%, 8 (95% CI 5 to 15) people would be falsely positive and 2 (95% CI 2 to 3) would be missed, for every 1000 people undergoing IgG or IgM testing in week three after onset of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. The reviewers pooled specificities across all time points for each test; average specificity ranged from 98.6% for IgM to 99.8% for total antibodies. It is worth noting that all of the included studies were at high risk of bias for at least one of the four quality criteria assessed.",

            "llm_answer": "The accuracy of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM antibody tests for the detection of current SARS-CoV-2 infection can vary depending on several factors, such as the type of test used, the timing of the test, and the individual's immune response to the virus.\nIgM antibodies are typically the first antibodies produced in response to a SARS-CoV-2 infection and can be detected within a few days to a week after infection. However, the accuracy of IgM tests can be affected by factors such as the sensitivity and specificity of the test, the timing of the test, and the presence of any underlying medical conditions.\nIgG antibodies, on the other hand, are produced later in the course of infection and can remain detectable for longer periods of time. The accuracy of IgG tests is generally higher than that of IgM tests, but it can still be affected by factors such as the type of test used and the individual's immune response.\nStudies have shown that the accuracy of IgG and IgM tests for detecting current SARS-CoV-2 infection can range from 80% to 100% for IgG tests and 70% to 90% for IgM tests. However, these estimates can vary depending on the specific test and population being studied.\nIt's important to note that antibody tests are not perfect and false negatives can occur, especially in the early stages of infection. Therefore, it's important to interpret test results in the context of the individual's symptoms, medical history, and exposure risk.\nIn summary, the accuracy of IgG and IgM antibody tests for detecting current SARS-CoV-2 infection can vary depending on several factors, and it's important to interpret test results in the context of the individual's symptoms, medical history, and exposure risk.",

In addition, children who received corticosteroids may have a shorter hospital stay (on average, by 1 day) and a shorter duration of symptoms (fever and rash; on average, by 1.34 days; low\u2010certainty evidence). No deaths or serious corticosteroid\u2010related adverse effects were recorded among the enrolled children. No studies assessed longer\u2010term coronary morbidity.",

The effects of corticosteroids in children with Kawasaki disease include:\n1. Reduced inflammation: Corticosteroids help to reduce the inflammation in the blood vessels, which can help to prevent further damage to the vessels and reduce the risk of complications.\n2. Fever reduction: Corticosteroids can help to reduce fever, which is a common symptom of Kawasaki disease.\n3. Pain relief: Corticosteroids can help to reduce pain and discomfort associated with the disease.\n4. Improved heart function: Corticosteroids can help to improve heart function, which can be affected in children with Kawasaki disease.\n5. Reduced risk of coronary artery aneurysms: Corticosteroids have been shown to reduce the risk of coronary artery aneurysms, a common complication of Kawasaki disease.\n6. Improved outcome: Corticosteroids have been shown to improve the overall outcome for children with Kawasaki disease, reducing the risk of complications and improving long-term health outcomes.\nIt's important to note that corticosteroids can have side effects, especially when used for long periods of time or in high doses. Therefore, the use of corticosteroids in children with Kawasaki disease should be carefully monitored and managed by a healthcare professional.",

In addition, children who received corticosteroids may have a shorter hospital stay (on average, by 1 day) and a shorter duration of symptoms (fever and rash; on average, by 1.34 days; low\u2010certainty evidence). No deaths or serious corticosteroid\u2010related adverse effects were recorded among the enrolled children. No studies assessed longer\u2010term coronary morbidity.",

Also used during pregnancy in women who are thought may have their baby prematurely. They reduce the chance of the baby having problems from being born prematurely. See also steroids.\nCORONARY (coronary): related to the blood vessels that supply the heart, or to the heart itself\nASSESS (assess): to learn about, measure, evaluate, look at\nSYMPTOM (symptom): A specific medical sign of a condition, illness or disease.\nMORBIDITY (morbidity): undesired result or complication",

            "llm_answer": "Corticosteroids are commonly used to treat children with Kawasaki disease, a rare autoimmune disease that causes inflammation in the blood vessels. The effects of corticosteroids on children with Kawasaki disease can include:\n1. Reduced inflammation: Corticosteroids can help reduce the inflammation in the blood vessels and other parts of the body that are affected by the disease.\n2. Fever reduction: Corticosteroids can help reduce fever, which is a common symptom of Kawasaki disease.\n3. Pain relief: Corticosteroids can help relieve pain and discomfort associated with the disease.\n4. Improved heart function: Corticosteroids can help improve heart function, which can be affected by the disease.\n5. Reduced risk of complications: Corticosteroids can help reduce the risk of complications associated with Kawasaki disease, such as aneurysms and heart failure.\nIt's important to note that corticosteroids can have side effects, especially when used for long periods of time or in high doses. Common side effects include weight gain, mood changes, and increased risk of infections. It's important to work closely with a healthcare provider to monitor for these side effects and adjust the dosage or medication as needed.\nIt's also important to note that corticosteroids are not a cure for Kawasaki disease, and they are not effective for all children with the disease. In some cases, other treatments such as intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) may be more effective. It's important to work closely with a healthcare provider to determine the best treatment plan for each individual child.",

            "gold_answer": "For adults with a range of chronic or acute illnesses (including rheumatoid arthritis, blood disorders, infectious diseases, alcoholism, liver cirrhosis, or renal failure) who were inpatients or were attending outpatient or primary health care centers, average sensitivities for serum ferritin (most often measured by enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay radioimmunoassay techniques) ranged from 0% to 100% (28/63 estimates \u2265 80%), and specificities, when estimable, ranged from 0% to 100% (42/61 estimates \u2265 90%). Reviewers used three prespecified levels of specificity (75%, 85%, and 95%; corresponding sensitivities are 95%, 90%, and 71%, respectively; all further results on average) to calculate the number of people who may be misclassified by serum ferritin. For every 1000 people tested, at a prevalence of 35% and a specificity of 75%, 162 people could be wrongly diagnosed with iron deficiency and 19 cases could be missed. At 85% specificity, the numbers could be 97 and 35 people, respectively. At 95% specificity, the numbers could be 32 and 100 people, respectively. Nine studies (512 participants [10% of study participants]) used a positivity threshold of 30 \u00b5g/L for iron deficiency; pooled sensitivity at this threshold was 79% and specificity 98%, suggesting that for every 1000 people tested at a prevalence of 40%, 12 people could be wrongly diagnosed with iron deficiency, and 85 cases could be missed. At this threshold, the probability of iron deficiency would increase from 40% to approx. 96% after a positive test, and would decrease from 40% to approx. 11% after a negative test.",

            "llm_answer": "The accuracy of ferritin as a marker for iron deficiency in non-healthy adults can vary depending on the individual's health status and other factors. Ferritin is a protein that stores and releases iron in the body, and its levels can be used to diagnose iron deficiency anemia. However, in non-healthy adults, ferritin levels may not always accurately reflect iron status due to various factors such as inflammation, chronic diseases, and medications that can affect ferritin production and iron metabolism.\nStudies have shown that ferritin levels can be elevated in certain conditions, such as chronic kidney disease, liver disease, and cancer, which can make it difficult to diagnose iron deficiency anemia. Additionally, some medications, such as corticosteroids and certain antibiotics, can increase ferritin levels, leading to a false positive diagnosis of iron deficiency.\nTherefore, it is important to interpret ferritin levels in the context of the individual's overall health status and medical history. A healthcare professional should consider other diagnostic tests, such as hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, red blood cell indices, and iron studies, to confirm the diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia.\nIn summary, while ferritin is a useful marker for iron deficiency in healthy adults, its accuracy may be affected in non-healthy adults due to various factors. A healthcare professional should use a combination of diagnostic tests and clinical evaluation to accurately diagnose and treat iron deficiency anemia in this population.",

Exercise has been found to improve cardiovascular health, increase muscle strength and endurance, and enhance overall physical function in individuals with CKD. Additionally, regular physical activity has been linked to a lower risk of depression, anxiety, and cognitive decline in this population.\nOn the other hand, a lack of exercise has been associated with a decline in physical fitness and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, which is a major complication of CKD. In fact, research has shown that sedentary behavior is a significant predictor of mortality in patients with CKD.\nIt is important to note that the benefits of exercise for adults with CKD are generally seen in individuals who engage in moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, for at least 150 minutes per week, or 75 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise, or an equivalent combination of both. Additionally, resistance training exercises can also be beneficial for improving muscle strength and endurance.\nIt is always recommended to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any exercise program, especially for individuals with CKD. A healthcare professional can help determine the most appropriate exercise plan based on an individual's specific health needs and abilities.",

Moderate\u2010quality evidence showed that this benefit was not sustained in the longer\u2010term (5 years). Low\u2010quality evidence suggests there was no benefit of an adjunctive corticosteroid in terms of reducing rates of disabling neurological deficit, ether within 24 months or at 5 years. There was no apparent impact of adjunctive corticosteroids on the incidences of hepatitis, hyperglycemia/glycosuria, gastrointestinal bleeding, or invasive bacterial infection but event rates were very low meaning conclusions cannot be drawn.",

Studies have consistently demonstrated that corticosteroids reduce the risk of death and disability in patients with tuberculous meningitis, particularly in those with severe disease. The use of corticosteroids has been associated with a significant reduction in mortality rates, from approximately 30-40% in untreated patients to around 10-20% in patients receiving corticosteroids. Additionally, corticosteroids have been shown to reduce the risk of long-term disability, such as hearing loss and cognitive impairment. However, the optimal dosage and duration of corticosteroid therapy for tuberculous meningitis are still uncertain and require further research.",

Moderate\u2010quality evidence showed that this benefit was not sustained in the longer\u2010term (5 years). Low\u2010quality evidence suggests there was no benefit of an adjunctive corticosteroid in terms of reducing rates of disabling neurological deficit, ether within 24 months or at 5 years. There was no apparent impact of adjunctive corticosteroids on the incidences of hepatitis, hyperglycemia/glycosuria, gastrointestinal bleeding, or invasive bacterial infection but event rates were very low meaning conclusions cannot be drawn.",

Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that in pregnant women who received probiotics, the risk of preterm birth (< 37 weeks) and miscarriage/stillbirth was no more or less likely compared with those who did not receive probiotics. Only one RCT (159 infants) reported no incidences of early neonatal sepsis (\u2264 3 days) in either trial arm. For most outcomes, event rates were very low or there were no events in both arms. There is a lack of data on neonatal short\u2010term (early or late sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, neonatal death, hospital stay) and long\u2010term (major neurodevelopmental disability) potential benefits or harms following probiotic administration. None of the trials included women with a previous history of preterm birth, multiple pregnancy, or uterine anomaly.

            "question": "Can probiotics administered to pregnant women help prevent morbidity and mortality in preterm infants?",
            "gold_answer": "Reviewers found no conclusive RCT evidence suggesting that administration of probiotics to pregnant women was superior or inferior to placebo in reducing morbidity or mortality in preterm infants. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that in pregnant women who received probiotics, the risk of preterm birth (< 37 weeks) and miscarriage/stillbirth was no more or less likely compared with those who did not receive probiotics. Only one RCT (159 infants) reported no incidences of early neonatal sepsis (\u2264 3 days) in either trial arm. For most outcomes, event rates were very low or there were no events in both arms. There is a lack of data on neonatal short\u2010term (early or late sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, neonatal death, hospital stay) and long\u2010term (major neurodevelopmental disability) potential benefits or harms following probiotic administration. None of the trials included women with a previous history of preterm birth, multiple pregnancy, or uterine anomaly. Reviewers did not assess serious adverse maternal or neonatal adverse events following use of probiotics.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "RCT (rct): A study which tests the effectiveness and safety of treatments or procedures as fairly and objectively as possible. By randomly assigning patients to different treatments for the same problem, the results can be assessed equally with the aim of discovering the best possible procedure for the condition.\nPLACEBO (placebo): an inactive substance; a pill/liquid that contains no medicine\nMORBIDITY (morbidity): undesired result or complication\nMORTALITY (mortality): death\nRISK (risk): The chance that an activity or hazard will give rise to harm. Risk is generally given in terms of numerical odds (1 in 10) or percentages (10%).\nSEPSIS (sepsis): The immune system's overreaction to an infection or injury which can lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and death.\nPOTENTIAL (potential): possible\nPOTENTIATE (potentiate): increase or multiply the effect of a drug or toxin (poison) by giving another drug or toxin at the same time (sometimes an unintentional result)\nPOTENTIATOR (potentiator): an agent that helps another agent work better\nASSESS (assess): to learn about, measure, evaluate, look at",

            "llm_answer": "Yes, probiotics administered to pregnant women have been shown to help prevent morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that can help maintain a healthy gut microbiome, which is important for the development and function of various bodily systems, including the immune system.\nStudies have found that probiotics can help reduce the risk of preterm birth, which is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Probiotics have also been shown to reduce the risk of other complications in preterm infants, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious condition that can cause damage to the intestines.\nIt's important to note that not all probiotics are the same, and some strains have been found to be more effective than others in preventing morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. For example, the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any supplements during pregnancy, including probiotics, to ensure safety and effectiveness. Additionally, it's important to note that while probiotics can help reduce the risk of complications, they are not a guarantee against them, and other factors such as proper prenatal care, a healthy diet, and a safe delivery are also important for a healthy pregnancy and baby.",
