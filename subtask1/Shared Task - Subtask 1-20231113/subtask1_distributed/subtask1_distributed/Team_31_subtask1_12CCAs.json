            "gold_answer": "For children (where reported, mean age one to three years) presenting to the emergency department (ED) or hospitalized with croup, the use of a glucocorticoid substantially improved croup scores at two (moderate\u2010certainty evidence) to 24 (low\u2010certainty evidence) hours when compared with placebo. The number of children with improved symptoms was also greater at 6 to 24 hours with a glucocorticoid (184 to 206 more children improved per 1000 children; all results on average). In addition, duration of hospital stay was shorter (by 15 hours), and fewer children returned to the ED or were readmitted to hospital (79 vs 153 per 1000 children) when administered a glucocorticoid. The impact of glucocorticoid on the need for additional treatments such as antibiotics, epinephrine, intubation/tracheostomy, and supplemental glucocorticoids remains unclear. Adverse events were sparsely reported and were assessed in too few children to provide a reliable assessment; the lack of an adverse event profile to supplement the efficacy data precludes any firm conclusions. Glucocorticoid versus epinephrine was assessed in too few children (32 to 130) to permit any conclusions.",

Reduced pain: Alpha-blockers can help reduce the pain associated with passing the stone.\n3. Faster stone passage: Studies have shown that alpha-blockers can increase the rate of stone passage after shock wave lithotripsy.\n4. Reduced risk of complications: Alpha-blockers may reduce the risk of complications such as ureteral injury or bleeding during the passage of the stone.\n5. Shorter hospital stay: Alpha-blockers can help patients recover faster, potentially reducing the need for a prolonged hospital stay.\nIt's important to note that alpha-blockers are not effective for all types of stones, and their effectiveness may vary depending on the size and location of the stone.

            "llm_answer": "Push and gravity are two common methods used for intermittent bolus gavage tube feeding of premature and low birth weight infants. The main difference between the two methods is the way the feeding solution is delivered through the nasogastric tube.\nPush feeding involves manually injecting a small amount of feeding solution into the nasogastric tube using a syringe or pump, which simulates the natural feeding process and allows for more precise control over the amount of feed given. Gravity feeding, on the other hand, involves allowing the feeding solution to flow into the nasogastric tube under the force of gravity, without the use of a pump or syringe.\nStudies have shown that both push and gravity feeding methods have their own advantages and disadvantages. Push feeding may be more effective in promoting gastric emptying and reducing the risk of gastroesophageal reflux, as it allows for more precise control over the amount of feed given and can be tailored to the infant's individual needs. However, push feeding may also be more time-consuming and may require more skill and training to administer.\nGravity feeding, on the other hand, is simpler and less time-consuming, as it does not require the use of a pump or syringe. However, it may not be as effective in promoting gastric emptying, and may be associated with a higher risk of gastroesophageal reflux and aspiration.\nUltimately, the choice between push and gravity feeding will depend on the individual needs and circumstances of the infant, as well as the preferences and expertise of the healthcare provider. It is important to carefully consider the benefits and risks of each method and to closely monitor the infant's response to ensure that they are receiving adequate nutrition and that any potential complications are minimized.",

            "llm_answer": "Intermittent bolus gavage tube feeding is a method of feeding premature and low birth weight infants, where a small amount of milk or formula is given through a nasogastric tube at regular intervals. The two main methods of intermittent bolus gavage tube feeding are push and gravity.\nPush feeding involves using a syringe or pump to administer the feed directly into the stomach through the nasogastric tube, usually over a short period of time (e.g., 1-2 minutes). Gravity feeding, on the other hand, involves allowing the feed to flow into the stomach by gravity, using a heightened position of the feeding bag or container.\nBoth push and gravity feeding have their advantages and disadvantages. Push feeding can be more efficient and may be better for infants who have difficulty coordinating their swallowing and breathing, as it allows for more control over the flow of the feed. However, it may also be more stressful for the infant, as the feed is administered more quickly and may cause discomfort or gagging.\nGravity feeding, on the other hand, may be more comfortable for the infant, as the feed flows more naturally and at a slower rate. However, it may also be less efficient, as the flow of the feed may be affected by the position of the infant and the height of the feeding bag or container.\nThere is limited research comparing the effects of push versus gravity feeding in premature and low birth weight infants. A study published in the Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition found that both push and gravity feeding were effective in providing nutrition to premature infants, but that push feeding may be associated with a lower risk of feeding intolerance and necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious complication that can occur in premature infants.\nIt's important to note that the choice between push and gravity feeding should be individualized and based on the specific needs and circumstances of each infant. Healthcare providers should consider factors such as the infant's gestational age, birth weight, and medical condition, as well as their ability to coordinate their swallowing and breathing, when",

            "gold_answer": "For people who are both uninfected and unvaccinated at risk of exposure to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, tixagevimab/cilgavimab result in a lower risk of developing clinical COVID\u201019 symptoms and likely a lower risk of experiencing SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. Casirivimab/imdevimab may lead to a decreased risk of developing clinical COVID\u201019 symptoms and experiencing SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection, but also to a higher risk of all\u2010grade adverse events. Effects of these monoclonal antibodies on other outcomes are less certain. Based on high\u2010 to moderate\u2010certainty evidence, results show that fewer people develop clinical COVID\u201019 symptoms within six months (3 vs 18 per 1000 people; all results on average), and probably fewer people experience infection with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 within six months with tixagevimab/cilgavimab than with placebo (12 vs 27 per 1000 people). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that fewer people may be admitted to hospital within six months with tixagevimab/cilgavimab than with placebo, although event rates were very low (0 vs 4 per 1000 people). There was little to no difference between groups in all\u2010cause mortality, adverse events and serious adverse events. Quality of life, adverse events grade 1 to 2, and 3 to 4 were not assessed. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that fewer people may develop clinical COVID\u201019 symptoms within six months (1 vs 42 per 1000 people), and fewer people may experience SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection within six months (1 vs 96 per 1000 people) with casirivimab/imdevimab than with placebo. All\u2010grade adverse events may be more common with casirivimab/imdevimab (551 vs 483 per 1000 people), while results for adverse events grade 3 to 4 and serious adverse events were imprecise. Evidence on all\u2010cause mortality was very uncertain, and no information was available for admission to hospital within six months, quality of life, or adverse events grade 1 to 2.",

These antibodies, also known as prophylactic antibodies, can be given to individuals before they are exposed to the virus to prevent infection. They work by neutralizing the virus, preventing it from entering cells and replicating. Studies have shown that these antibodies can be effective in preventing COVID-19 in certain populations, such as healthcare workers and individuals who have been exposed to someone with COVID-19.

            "gold_answer": "For people who are both uninfected and unvaccinated at risk of exposure to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, tixagevimab/cilgavimab result in a lower risk of developing clinical COVID\u201019 symptoms and likely a lower risk of experiencing SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. Casirivimab/imdevimab may lead to a decreased risk of developing clinical COVID\u201019 symptoms and experiencing SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection, but also to a higher risk of all\u2010grade adverse events. Effects of these monoclonal antibodies on other outcomes are less certain. Based on high\u2010 to moderate\u2010certainty evidence, results show that fewer people develop clinical COVID\u201019 symptoms within six months (3 vs 18 per 1000 people; all results on average), and probably fewer people experience infection with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 within six months with tixagevimab/cilgavimab than with placebo (12 vs 27 per 1000 people). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that fewer people may be admitted to hospital within six months with tixagevimab/cilgavimab than with placebo, although event rates were very low (0 vs 4 per 1000 people). There was little to no difference between groups in all\u2010cause mortality, adverse events and serious adverse events. Quality of life, adverse events grade 1 to 2, and 3 to 4 were not assessed. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that fewer people may develop clinical COVID\u201019 symptoms within six months (1 vs 42 per 1000 people), and fewer people may experience SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection within six months (1 vs 96 per 1000 people) with casirivimab/imdevimab than with placebo. All\u2010grade adverse events may be more common with casirivimab/imdevimab (551 vs 483 per 1000 people), while results for adverse events grade 3 to 4 and serious adverse events were imprecise. Evidence on all\u2010cause mortality was very uncertain, and no information was available for admission to hospital within six months, quality of life, or adverse events grade 1 to 2.",

These antibodies are lab-produced proteins that are designed to bind to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and neutralize its ability to infect cells. They have been shown to be effective in preventing COVID-19 in certain situations, such as in people who have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 or in people who are at high risk of severe illness from COVID-19. However, it's important to note that they are not 100% effective and are not a substitute for other COVID-19 prevention measures such as wearing masks, social distancing, and vaccination.

            "gold_answer": "Despite certain outcomes that appear to favor very early treatment, the certainty of evidence for these outcomes is low to very low, and no clear differences in the other major outcomes are shown by higher\u2010certainty evidence. Overall, evidence is insufficient to show clear benefit of very early treatment over expectant management for preterm infants with hemodynamically significant PDA. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows no clear differences between infants who received very early treatment and those receiving expectant management for all\u2010cause mortality in hospital, need for surgical PDA ligation or transcatheter occlusion, grades III and IV intraventricular hemorrhage, or necrotizing enterocolitis (Bell's stage 2 or greater). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests no clear differences between groups in the overall incidence of chronic lung disease, despite a possible reduction in chronic lung disease among the subgroup of those who received very early ibuprofen (on average, 355 vs 656 per 1000 infants). Although it appears that more infants who received very early treatment ended up receiving medication for PDA, this observation was supported by evidence of very low certainty. Based on six RCTs (253 infants), infants who received very early treatment appeared to have slightly shorter days on ventilator support (on average, 0.45 day shorter), with no clear difference in the duration of supplementary oxygen (3 RCTs, 127 infants). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that infants who received very early treatment may have shorter duration of hospitalization, with a mean reduction of around 5.35 days of stay. Low\u2010certainty evidence also suggests no clear differences between groups in oliguria or in neurodevelopmental impairment, including risk of moderate to severe cognitive, motor, or language delay, but analyses were underpowered and included only a single RCT.",

            "llm_answer": "Very early treatment (within three days) of hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm infants has been shown to have several advantages compared to expectant management. These advantages include:\n* Reduced risk of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC)\n* Lower incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)\n* Improved survival rates\n* Reduced need for respiratory support and oxygen therapy\n* Shorter hospital stay\n* Fewer complications, such as pulmonary hemorrhage and sepsis\nEarly treatment is thought to be more effective in closing the PDA and preventing complications because the ductus arteriosus is more responsive to treatment at this age, and the risk of complications is lower. However, it's important to note that early treatment may also have some risks, such as an increased risk of bleeding and the need for multiple doses of medication. The decision to treat a PDA in preterm infants should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the infant's gestational age, clinical condition, and other individual factors.",

            "gold_answer": "Despite certain outcomes that appear to favor very early treatment, the certainty of evidence for these outcomes is low to very low, and no clear differences in the other major outcomes are shown by higher\u2010certainty evidence. Overall, evidence is insufficient to show clear benefit of very early treatment over expectant management for preterm infants with hemodynamically significant PDA. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows no clear differences between infants who received very early treatment and those receiving expectant management for all\u2010cause mortality in hospital, need for surgical PDA ligation or transcatheter occlusion, grades III and IV intraventricular hemorrhage, or necrotizing enterocolitis (Bell's stage 2 or greater). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests no clear differences between groups in the overall incidence of chronic lung disease, despite a possible reduction in chronic lung disease among the subgroup of those who received very early ibuprofen (on average, 355 vs 656 per 1000 infants). Although it appears that more infants who received very early treatment ended up receiving medication for PDA, this observation was supported by evidence of very low certainty. Based on six RCTs (253 infants), infants who received very early treatment appeared to have slightly shorter days on ventilator support (on average, 0.45 day shorter), with no clear difference in the duration of supplementary oxygen (3 RCTs, 127 infants). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that infants who received very early treatment may have shorter duration of hospitalization, with a mean reduction of around 5.35 days of stay. Low\u2010certainty evidence also suggests no clear differences between groups in oliguria or in neurodevelopmental impairment, including risk of moderate to severe cognitive, motor, or language delay, but analyses were underpowered and included only a single RCT.",

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers provided evidence for 13 physical interventions used to reduce the spread of respiratory viruses (including medical/surgical masks, N95 respirators, hand hygiene, surface/object disinfection, quarantine, and gargling water used alone or in combination). Compared with no mask wearing, medical or surgical masks probably have little impact on the incidence of influenza/COVID\u2010like illness and probably have little impact on the incidence of confirmed influenza (moderate\u2010certainty evidence). All but two trials were conducted during influenza seasons and not in pandemic settings. The largest trial completed during the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 pandemic had a mask adherence of 42% in the intervention group and 13% in the control group. Interventions that promote hand hygiene probably reduce the incidence of acute respiratory illness (327 vs 380 per 1000 people; moderate\u2010certainty evidence; all results on average) compared with no intervention. The effects of N95 respirators versus medical/surgical masks on clinical respiratory illness and unconfirmed influenza\u2010like illness are uncertain (both comparisons included studies conducted in non\u2010pandemic settings). One RCT with 15,134 participants reported an incidence of influenza among coworkers of 2.8% when employees with influenza were asked to stay at home for five days if a member of their household had influenza\u2010like symptoms versus 3.2% with no encouragement to self\u2010isolate, but two other RCTs evaluating physical distancing during the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 pandemic resulted in little to no difference between groups. The remaining comparisons showed little to no difference between groups or uncertain effects.",

These interventions include:\n* Social distancing: maintaining a safe distance from others, both physically and virtually, to reduce the chance of close contact\n* Personal protective equipment (PPE): wearing masks, gloves, and gowns to prevent contact with respiratory secretions\n* Improved ventilation: increasing airflow and using HEPA filters to remove viral particles from the air\n* Hand hygiene: frequent handwashing or using hand sanitizer to reduce the transmission of viruses through contact\n* Screening: checking for symptoms and temperature checks to identify and isolate infected individuals\n* Environmental cleaning: regularly disinfecting surfaces and objects that are frequently touched to reduce the spread of viruses.\nBy implementing these physical interventions, the spread of respiratory viruses can be reduced, particularly in high-risk settings such as healthcare facilities, schools, and public gatherings.",

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers provided evidence for 13 physical interventions used to reduce the spread of respiratory viruses (including medical/surgical masks, N95 respirators, hand hygiene, surface/object disinfection, quarantine, and gargling water used alone or in combination). Compared with no mask wearing, medical or surgical masks probably have little impact on the incidence of influenza/COVID\u2010like illness and probably have little impact on the incidence of confirmed influenza (moderate\u2010certainty evidence). All but two trials were conducted during influenza seasons and not in pandemic settings. The largest trial completed during the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 pandemic had a mask adherence of 42% in the intervention group and 13% in the control group. Interventions that promote hand hygiene probably reduce the incidence of acute respiratory illness (327 vs 380 per 1000 people; moderate\u2010certainty evidence; all results on average) compared with no intervention. The effects of N95 respirators versus medical/surgical masks on clinical respiratory illness and unconfirmed influenza\u2010like illness are uncertain (both comparisons included studies conducted in non\u2010pandemic settings). One RCT with 15,134 participants reported an incidence of influenza among coworkers of 2.8% when employees with influenza were asked to stay at home for five days if a member of their household had influenza\u2010like symptoms versus 3.2% with no encouragement to self\u2010isolate, but two other RCTs evaluating physical distancing during the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 pandemic resulted in little to no difference between groups. The remaining comparisons showed little to no difference between groups or uncertain effects.",

Social distancing: Keeping a safe distance from others, both physically and virtually, can help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses.\n2. Hand hygiene: Frequent hand-washing or using hand sanitizer can help reduce the transmission of viruses.\n3. Mask-wearing: Wearing masks can help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses by blocking respiratory droplets that may contain viruses.\n4. Surface cleaning and disinfection: Regularly cleaning and disinfecting high-touch surfaces and objects can help reduce the spread of viruses.\n5. Personal protective equipment (PPE): Using PPE, such as gloves, gowns, and face shields, can help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses in healthcare settings.\nIt's important to note that physical interventions should be used in conjunction with other measures, such as vaccination, screening, and isolation precautions, to effectively reduce the spread of respiratory viruses.",

Bamlanivimab may also lower risk of infection, but does not seem to impact other outcomes. High\u2010certainty evidence shows lower infections rates, lower risk of developing COVID\u201019 symptoms within 30 days, and lower all\u2010grade adverse event rate with casirivimab/imdevimab (94, 63, and 87 fewer people per 1000 people, respectively; all results on average) when compared with placebo. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests there may be little to no difference between groups in grade 3 to 4 adverse events and serious adverse events. Results for all\u2010cause mortality and admission to hospital were imprecise, and quality of life and adverse events grade were not assessed. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that probably fewer people become infected by day 30 with bamlanivimab than with placebo (176 vs 232 per 1000 people). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests there may be little to no difference between groups in all cause\u2010mortality by day 60, all\u2010grade adverse events, and serious adverse events by week 8.

Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that can help maintain a healthy gut microbiome, which is important for the development and function of various bodily systems, including the immune system.\nStudies have found that probiotics can help reduce the risk of preterm birth, which is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Probiotics have also been shown to reduce the risk of other complications in preterm infants, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious condition that can cause damage to the intestines.\nIt's important to note that not all probiotics are the same, and some strains have been found to be more effective than others in preventing morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. For example, the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any supplements during pregnancy, including probiotics, to ensure safety and effectiveness. Additionally, it's important to note that while probiotics can help reduce the risk of complications, they are not a guarantee against them, and other factors such as proper prenatal care, a healthy diet, and a safe delivery are also important for a healthy pregnancy and baby.",
