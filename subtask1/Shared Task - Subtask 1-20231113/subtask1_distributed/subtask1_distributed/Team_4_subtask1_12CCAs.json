            "gold_answer": "Reviewers identified studies that performed ABeta42 testing using spinal fluid from people with Alzheimer's disease dementia and other types of dementia (diagnosed by a range of criteria) and reported sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease dementia. Pooled estimates of sensitivity for Alzheimer's disease dementia were 79% versus non\u2013Alzheimer's disease dementia or vascular dementia, 85% versus frontotemporal dementia, and 77% versus dementia with Lewy bodies. Pooled estimates of specificity for Alzheimer's disease dementia were 60% versus non\u2013Alzheimer's disease dementia, 69% versus vascular dementia, 72% versus frontotemporal dementia, and 66% versus dementia with Lewy bodies. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 60% to 70% of people with dementia have Alzheimer's disease. Using a prevalence of 65%, of every 1000 people with dementia tested, 98 to 140 people could be wrongly diagnosed as having Alzheimer's disease dementia, and 98 to 149 with Alzheimer's disease dementia could be missed. Based on pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity, likelihood ratios suggest that from a pretest probability of 65%, the probability of Alzheimer's disease dementia would increase to 78% to 83% after a positive spinal fluid ABeta42 test and would decrease to 30% to 37% after a negative test.",

Moreover, the interpretation of ABeta42 levels requires careful consideration of various factors, such as age, sex, and comorbidities.\nTherefore, while ABeta42 measurement in CSF can be a useful tool for the differential diagnosis of AD, it should be used in conjunction with other diagnostic markers, such as cognitive tests, neuroimaging, and clinical evaluation, to achieve the highest accuracy.",

These interventions typically involve a combination of physical, cognitive, and social activities aimed at promoting healthy lifestyle changes and cognitive stimulation.\nResearch has shown that multi-domain interventions can help to:\n1. Improve cognitive function: Studies have consistently shown that multi-domain interventions can improve cognitive function, particularly in areas such as memory, attention, and processing speed.\n2. Reduce the risk of dementia: Multi-domain interventions have been found to reduce the risk of dementia and cognitive decline in older adults, particularly those with mild cognitive impairment.\n3. Enhance physical health: These interventions often include physical activity components, which can help to improve physical health outcomes, such as cardiovascular health and mobility.\n4. Promote social engagement: Multi-domain interventions often involve group activities and social interactions, which can help to promote social engagement and reduce feelings of loneliness and isolation.\n5. Improve mental health: These interventions may also include components aimed at promoting mental health and well-being, such as stress management and relaxation techniques.\nIt is important to note that the effectiveness of multi-domain interventions can vary depending on factors such as the specific intervention components, the duration and intensity of the intervention, and the individual's starting level of cognitive and physical function. However, overall, multi-domain interventions have shown promise in promoting cognitive health and reducing the risk of dementia and cognitive decline.",

            "gold_answer": "For people with sore throat, high\u2010certainty evidence shows that, compared with placebo, antibiotics reduce the number of people with fever (152 vs 202 per 1000 people; all results on average), headache at day 3 (198 vs 404 per 1000 people), the incidence of otitis media within 14 days (2 vs 7 per 1000 people) and quinsy within 2 months (3 vs 17 per 1000 people). Trials contributing data to these analyses mostly used penicillin. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that antibiotics probably reduce sore throat at 3 and 7 days (199 and 94 fewer people per 1000, respectively, had a sore throat) and reduce rates of rheumatic fever within two months (8 vs 21 per 1000 people). Analyses of sinusitis and acute glomerulonephritis had low event rates. Adverse events were inconsistently recorded. Of note, comparisons were made with placebo rather than with analgesic medications used in common practice to treat symptoms. Also, symptom reduction needs to be balanced against potential adverse effects of antibiotics. To justify the use of antibiotics, the bacterial origin of the sore throat should first be confirmed.",

The benefits of antibiotics for bacterial sore throats include:\n* Reduced duration and severity of symptoms\n* Reduced risk of complications, such as tonsillitis or abscesses\n* May reduce the spread of infection to others\nHowever, there are also potential harms associated with antibiotic use, including:\n* Antibiotic resistance: Overuse and misuse of antibiotics can lead to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, making future infections harder to treat.\n* Side effects: Antibiotics can cause a range of side effects, such as upset stomach, diarrhea, and allergic reactions.\n* Cost: Antibiotics can be expensive, especially if they are not covered by insurance.\nIt's important to note that antibiotics are not recommended for viral sore throats, as they will not be effective in treating the infection. In these cases, symptomatic relief and supportive care, such as rest, hydration, and over-the-counter pain relievers, may be recommended instead.",

            "gold_answer": "For people with sore throat, high\u2010certainty evidence shows that, compared with placebo, antibiotics reduce the number of people with fever (152 vs 202 per 1000 people; all results on average), headache at day 3 (198 vs 404 per 1000 people), the incidence of otitis media within 14 days (2 vs 7 per 1000 people) and quinsy within 2 months (3 vs 17 per 1000 people). Trials contributing data to these analyses mostly used penicillin. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that antibiotics probably reduce sore throat at 3 and 7 days (199 and 94 fewer people per 1000, respectively, had a sore throat) and reduce rates of rheumatic fever within two months (8 vs 21 per 1000 people). Analyses of sinusitis and acute glomerulonephritis had low event rates. Adverse events were inconsistently recorded. Of note, comparisons were made with placebo rather than with analgesic medications used in common practice to treat symptoms. Also, symptom reduction needs to be balanced against potential adverse effects of antibiotics. To justify the use of antibiotics, the bacterial origin of the sore throat should first be confirmed.",

However, antibiotics are ineffective against viral infections, which are the most common cause of sore throats.\nThe potential harms of antibiotics include:\n* Allergic reactions\n* Side effects such as nausea, diarrhea, and yeast infections\n* Contribution to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria\n* Increased risk of Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) infection\n* Increased risk of developing fungal infections\nIt's important to note that antibiotics should only be prescribed by a healthcare professional and used under their guidance. Overuse or misuse of antibiotics can lead to negative consequences for the individual and society as a whole.\nIn addition to antibiotics, there are other ways to manage a sore throat, such as:\n* Staying hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids\n* Gargling with salt water\n* Using a humidifier to add moisture to the air\n* Taking over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen\n* Resting and avoiding strenuous activities\nIt's important to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment of a sore throat, as they can determine the cause and recommend the most appropriate treatment.",

            "llm_answer": "Adjuvant capecitabine-containing regimens and non-capecitabine-containing regimens are both used to treat invasive breast cancer, but they differ in their composition and potential side effects.\nAdjuvant capecitabine-containing regimens typically include capecitabine (Xeloda) in combination with other chemotherapy drugs. Capecitabine is an oral chemotherapy drug that works by interfering with the growth and division of cancer cells. It is usually taken twice a day for 14 days, followed by a 7-day rest period.\nAdjuvant non-capecitabine-containing regimens, on the other hand, may include other chemotherapy drugs such as anthracyclines, taxanes, and/or platinum-based drugs. These regimens are often used in combination with hormone therapy or targeted therapy, depending on the type of breast cancer.\nBoth types of regimens have been shown to be effective in treating invasive breast cancer, and the choice between them depends on various factors, including the stage and biology of the cancer, patient age and overall health, and other individual factors.\nA 2018 meta-analysis published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology compared the outcomes of adjuvant capecitabine-containing and non-capecitabine-containing regimens in patients with invasive breast cancer. The study found that both types of regimens were effective in reducing the risk of disease recurrence and improving overall survival, but the capecitabine-containing regimens were associated with a higher risk of certain side effects, such as hand-foot syndrome and diarrhea.\nIt's important to note that the choice of treatment regimen should be individualized and discussed with a qualified healthcare professional, taking into account the patient's specific needs and medical history.",

            "gold_answer": "The RCTs comparing high versus low VNS in people with drug\u2010resistant partial epilepsy may not be applicable to current clinical practice. Since these studies were published, numerous new antiepileptic medications for partial seizures have been released, therefore the participants in the trials may not be representative of patients who would at this time be defined as having drug\u2010resistant partial seizures. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that more people receiving VNS using high stimulation rather than low simulation had a 50% or greater reduction in frequency of drug\u2010resistant partial seizures. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that analysis of withdrawals was underpowered and resulted in very imprecise results. Voice alteration and dyspnea occurred more frequently with high stimulation (353 and 154 more people per 1000, respectively). Other adverse effects associated with VNS implantation, regardless of stimulation level, were cough, pain, and paresthesia. Only two studies reported on quality of life, both of which favored VNS, but with no apparent difference between high and low stimulation. Of note, the included studies only covered a short treatment follow\u2010up (with the longest period of 20 weeks), and all were sponsored by the VNS manufacturer.",

            "gold_answer": "The RCTs comparing high versus low VNS in people with drug\u2010resistant partial epilepsy may not be applicable to current clinical practice. Since these studies were published, numerous new antiepileptic medications for partial seizures have been released, therefore the participants in the trials may not be representative of patients who would at this time be defined as having drug\u2010resistant partial seizures. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that more people receiving VNS using high stimulation rather than low simulation had a 50% or greater reduction in frequency of drug\u2010resistant partial seizures. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that analysis of withdrawals was underpowered and resulted in very imprecise results. Voice alteration and dyspnea occurred more frequently with high stimulation (353 and 154 more people per 1000, respectively). Other adverse effects associated with VNS implantation, regardless of stimulation level, were cough, pain, and paresthesia. Only two studies reported on quality of life, both of which favored VNS, but with no apparent difference between high and low stimulation. Of note, the included studies only covered a short treatment follow\u2010up (with the longest period of 20 weeks), and all were sponsored by the VNS manufacturer.",

            "gold_answer": "No firm conclusions can be drawn on the benefits of urgent\u2010start peritoneal dialysis (PD) over urgent\u2010start hemodialysis (HD), as all available evidence is of low or very low certainty, and no randomized controlled trials have been identified. Based on seven cohort studies (991 participants), urgent\u2010start PD appears to have broadly similar outcomes to urgent\u2010start central venous catheter HD. Urgent\u2010start PD may be associated with lower rates of bacteremia (on average, 14 vs 110 per 1000 people) but higher rates of exit site infection (on average, 71 vs 18 per 1000 people) when compared with urgent\u2010start central venous catheter HD (low\u2010 and very low\u2010certainty evidence, respectively). Rates of catheter malfunction were also lower with urgent\u2010start PD (on average, 33 vs 128 per 1000 people). Reviewers found no data on quality of life nor on rates of home dialysis.",

            "llm_answer": "Urgent-start peritoneal dialysis (PD) and urgent-start central venous catheter hemodialysis (HD) are both effective methods for treating adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who require urgent dialysis initiation. However, there are some differences between the two methods.\nUrgent-start PD involves inserting a catheter into the peritoneal cavity and initiating dialysis within a few days of catheter insertion. This method is associated with several advantages, including:\n1. Faster recovery time: PD can be initiated within 24-48 hours of catheter insertion, which can lead to faster recovery times compared to HD.\n2. Reduced risk of infection: PD catheters are inserted into the peritoneal cavity, which is a sterile environment, reducing the risk of infection compared to HD catheters that are inserted into the bloodstream.\n3. Improved patient survival: Studies have shown that urgent-start PD is associated with improved patient survival compared to urgent-start HD.\n4. Greater flexibility: PD allows for greater flexibility in terms of dialysis scheduling and location, as it can be performed at home or in a dialysis center.\nOn the other hand, urgent-start HD involves inserting a central venous catheter and initiating dialysis within a few days of catheter insertion. This method is associated with several disadvantages, including:\n1. Increased risk of infection: HD catheters are inserted into the bloodstream, which increases the risk of infection compared to PD catheters.\n2. Longer recovery time: HD requires a longer recovery time compared to PD, as it can take several days to weeks for the catheter to mature and for dialysis to be effective.\n3. Increased cost: HD requires more resources and infrastructure compared to PD, which can increase costs.\nIn summary, urgent-start PD is associated with faster recovery times, reduced risk of infection, improved patient survival, and greater flexibility compared to urgent-start HD.

In adults with diabetic kidney disease, low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that a low\u2010protein diet may lead to little or no difference in death (7 vs 18 per 1000 people; all results on average) or kidney failure (57 vs 49 per 1000 people) when compared with a usual or unrestricted protein diet. The effects of a low\u2010protein diet on changes in renal function and proteinuria are uncertain (very low\u2010certainty evidence). Only one out of seven studies reported evidence of malnutrition in people on a low\u2010protein diet, and one RCT with 112 participants found no impact on health\u2010related quality of life. No studies reported adverse events.",

            "llm_answer": "Protein restriction can have several beneficial effects for people with diabetic kidney disease, including:\n1. Reduced proteinuria: High protein intake can increase proteinuria, which can worsen kidney damage. Limiting protein intake can help reduce proteinuria and slow the progression of kidney damage.\n2. Improved blood sugar control: Protein restriction can help improve blood sugar control by reducing the amount of glucose that needs to be filtered through the kidneys.\n3. Reduced blood pressure: Protein restriction can help lower blood pressure, which can reduce the strain on the kidneys and slow the progression of kidney damage.\n4. Reduced risk of kidney failure: By reducing proteinuria and improving blood sugar control, protein restriction can help reduce the risk of kidney failure in people with diabetic kidney disease.\n5. Improved overall health: Protein restriction can also help improve overall health by reducing the risk of other complications associated with diabetes, such as heart disease and stroke.\nIt's important to note that protein restriction should be done under the guidance of a healthcare professional, as excessive protein restriction can lead to muscle wasting and other negative health effects.",

In adults with diabetic kidney disease, low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that a low\u2010protein diet may lead to little or no difference in death (7 vs 18 per 1000 people; all results on average) or kidney failure (57 vs 49 per 1000 people) when compared with a usual or unrestricted protein diet. The effects of a low\u2010protein diet on changes in renal function and proteinuria are uncertain (very low\u2010certainty evidence). Only one out of seven studies reported evidence of malnutrition in people on a low\u2010protein diet, and one RCT with 112 participants found no impact on health\u2010related quality of life. No studies reported adverse events.",

            "llm_answer": "Protein restriction can have both positive and negative effects for people with diabetic kidney disease (DKD).\nPositive effects:\n1. Reduced protein intake can help reduce the amount of waste products that the kidneys need to filter, which can slow the progression of kidney damage.\n2. Lower protein intake can also help lower blood sugar levels, which can reduce the risk of kidney damage and other diabetes-related complications.\nNegative effects:\n1. Protein restriction can lead to muscle wasting and weakness, which can make it harder for people with DKD to manage their blood sugar levels and perform daily activities.\n2. Low protein intake can also lead to a decrease in albumin, a protein that helps regulate fluid balance in the body. This can cause swelling, fluid accumulation, and other complications.\nIt's important to note that the optimal amount of protein for people with DKD is still a topic of debate, and more research is needed to determine the ideal amount of protein for this population. It's recommended that people with DKD work with a registered dietitian or healthcare provider to determine the appropriate amount of protein for their individual needs. Additionally, it's important to ensure that the diet is balanced and includes a variety of nutrient-dense foods to support overall health.",

            "gold_answer": "RT techniques such as three\u2010dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT), intensity\u2010modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), and brachytherapy show benefits in terms of adverse GI effects compared with conventional RT techniques. Among adults receiving RT for primary pelvic cancer (92% men with prostate cancer), high\u2010certainty evidence shows that fewer people had acute GI toxicity grade \u2265 2 with conformal RT (3DCRT or IMRT) than with conventional RT (184 vs 321 per 1000 people; all results on average). Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that probably fewer people had late GI toxicity grade \u2265 2 (79 versus 160 per 1000) and similar numbers of people required medication for GI symptom control, although effect estimates were imprecise. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that GI symptom scores (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer 25\u2010item module specific to prostate cancer [EORTC\u2010QLQPR25]) may be better with IMRT than with 3DCRT at six months (by 5 points) and at two years (by 7 points), although estimates were imprecise (52% women with cervical cancer and 48% men with localized prostate cancer). Fewer people may have acute GI toxicity grade \u2265 2, late GI toxicity grade \u2265 2, and diarrhea grade \u2265 2 with IMRT than with 3DCRT (306, 138, and 444 fewer people per 1000, respectively). High\u2010certainty evidence shows that fewer women with early\u2010stage endometrial cancer had acute GI toxicity grade \u2265 2 with brachytherapy than with external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) (5 versus 188 per 1000 women). Results for late GI toxicity grade \u2265 2 were imprecise. One RCT with 348 women with endometrial cancer reported better symptom scores for \u201climitation in daily activities due to bowel symptoms,\u201d \u201cfecal leakage,\u201d and \u201crectal blood loss\u201d but found no clear differences in global health status when brachytherapy was compared with EBRT (data not reported).",

            "llm_answer": "There are several radiotherapy techniques used to treat primary pelvic cancer, and the adverse gastrointestinal (GI) effects can vary depending on the technique used. Here are some of the most common techniques and their associated GI effects:\n1. External Beam Radiotherapy (EBRT): This is the most common type of radiotherapy used for pelvic cancer. It involves directing high-energy beams from a machine outside the body to the tumor site. EBRT can cause acute GI effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, especially during the first few weeks of treatment. Long-term effects can include rectal bleeding, ulcers, and narrowing of the rectum or colon.\n2. Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT): IMRT is a type of EBRT that uses advanced technology to deliver precise and targeted radiation to the tumor while minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissue. IMRT can reduce the risk of GI effects compared to standard EBRT, but some patients may still experience mild to moderate acute GI effects.\n3. Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT): SBRT is a type of radiation therapy that delivers high doses of radiation over a shorter period, typically 1-5 treatments. SBRT can cause fewer GI effects compared to EBRT, but some patients may still experience mild acute effects such as nausea and diarrhea.\n4. Proton Therapy: Proton therapy is a type of radiation therapy that uses protons instead of X-rays to destroy cancer cells. Proton therapy can reduce the risk of GI effects compared to EBRT, especially for patients with tumors located near critical organs such as the rectum, bladder, or bowel.

Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that can help maintain a healthy gut microbiome, which is important for the development and function of various bodily systems, including the immune system.\nStudies have found that probiotics can help reduce the risk of preterm birth, which is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Probiotics have also been shown to reduce the risk of other complications in preterm infants, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious condition that can cause damage to the intestines.\nIt's important to note that not all probiotics are the same, and some strains have been found to be more effective than others in preventing morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. For example, the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any supplements during pregnancy, including probiotics, to ensure safety and effectiveness. Additionally, it's important to note that while probiotics can help reduce the risk of complications, they are not a guarantee against them, and other factors such as proper prenatal care, a healthy diet, and a safe delivery are also important for a healthy pregnancy and baby.",
