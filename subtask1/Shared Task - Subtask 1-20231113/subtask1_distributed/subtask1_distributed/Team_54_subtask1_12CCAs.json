Reviewers rated evidence as low certainty for both outcomes.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "RCT (rct): A study which tests the effectiveness and safety of treatments or procedures as fairly and objectively as possible. By randomly assigning patients to different treatments for the same problem, the results can be assessed equally with the aim of discovering the best possible procedure for the condition.",

            "llm_answer": "Interventions aimed at increasing solid organ donor registration have been shown to be effective in improving donor registration rates. These interventions include:\n1. Public education campaigns: Educating the public about the importance of organ donation and the need for more donors can increase awareness and motivation to register.\n2. Opt-out consent systems: Implementing opt-out consent systems, where individuals are presumed to be donors unless they opt out, can increase registration rates.\n3. Online registration: Providing easy access to online registration systems can make it easier for individuals to sign up to be donors.\n4. Donor education: Educating healthcare professionals and the public about the donation process and the importance of discussing donation with patients and their families can increase the number of donors.\n5. Incentives: Offering incentives, such as paid leave or financial compensation, to individuals who register to be donors can increase registration rates.\n6. Family discussions: Encouraging individuals to discuss organ donation with their families can increase the likelihood that they will register to be donors.\n7. Healthcare provider advocacy: Healthcare providers can play a key role in promoting organ donation and encouraging patients to register.\n8. Social media campaigns: Utilizing social media platforms to promote organ donation and encourage registration can be an effective way to reach a large audience.\n9. Collaboration with community organizations: Partnering with community organizations and religious groups can help reach diverse populations and increase registration rates.\n10. Streamlining registration processes: Making the registration process easier and more accessible can increase the likelihood that individuals will sign up to be donors.\nOverall, a combination of these interventions can help increase solid organ donor registration rates and ultimately improve access to transplantation for those in need.",

Intention to register/donate also appears to be increased with an intervention to increase solid organ donor registration, but such intention was also low in both groups (79 vs 65 per 1000 people). Reviewers rated evidence as low certainty for both outcomes.",

Increased awareness: Educational campaigns and public outreach efforts can increase public awareness about organ donation and the importance of registering to become a donor.\n2. Increased registration rates: Targeted interventions, such as online registration drives, donor registration events, and mail-in registration campaigns, can significantly increase the number of people who register to become organ donors.\n3. Improved donor demographics: Interventions that target specific demographic groups, such as young people, minority communities, or those with lower socioeconomic status, can help to increase donor diversity and improve access to transplantation for underserved populations.\n4. Increased public support: Public education campaigns and media outreach can help to build public support for organ donation, reducing stigma and increasing willingness to discuss and consider donation.\n5. Improved donor pool quality: Interventions that focus on promoting healthy lifestyles and disease prevention can help to improve the quality of the donor pool, reducing the risk of complications and improving outcomes for transplant recipients.\n6. Reduced disparities: Targeted interventions that address disparities in access to transplantation, such as those related to race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status, can help to reduce disparities in organ donation and transplantation outcomes.\n7. Increased collaboration: Collaborative efforts between healthcare providers, community organizations, and government agencies can help to increase organ donation rates and improve transplantation outcomes.\nIt is important to note that the effectiveness of interventions can vary depending on factors such as population, setting, and implementation strategy.

Compared with attention control, more children and adolescents with anxiety disorders may achieve remission from their primary anxiety diagnosis (517 vs 320 per 1000 children; all results on average; low\u2010certainty evidence) and from all anxiety diagnoses (478 vs 250 per 1000 children; low certainty evidence) immediately following treatment with CBT. This could be sustained up to six months for the primary diagnosis (489 vs 238 per 1000 children) but not for all diagnoses (786 vs 404 per 1000 children). Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows a slightly greater reduction in child\u2010reported anxiety symptoms (15 RCTs, 978 children), with findings sustained up to six months (6 RCTs, 434 children). Reviewers found little to no difference in treatment acceptability (137 vs 136 per 1000 children; low\u2010certainty evidence) or in depressive symptoms (10 RCTs, 613 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence).

            "gold_answer": "For children and adolescents with anxiety disorders, cognitive\u2010behavioral therapy (CBT) might increase chances of remission for those with a primary anxiety diagnosis and all anxiety diagnoses while reducing anxiety symptoms compared with attention control placebo. Compared with attention control, more children and adolescents with anxiety disorders may achieve remission from their primary anxiety diagnosis (517 vs 320 per 1000 children; all results on average; low\u2010certainty evidence) and from all anxiety diagnoses (478 vs 250 per 1000 children; low certainty evidence) immediately following treatment with CBT. This could be sustained up to six months for the primary diagnosis (489 vs 238 per 1000 children) but not for all diagnoses (786 vs 404 per 1000 children). Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows a slightly greater reduction in child\u2010reported anxiety symptoms (15 RCTs, 978 children), with findings sustained up to six months (6 RCTs, 434 children). Reviewers found little to no difference in treatment acceptability (137 vs 136 per 1000 children; low\u2010certainty evidence) or in depressive symptoms (10 RCTs, 613 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). No trials assessed adverse events, and evidence was insufficient for judgment of global functioning.",

            "llm_answer": "Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and attention control are two different approaches that can be effective in treating anxiety disorders in children and adolescents.\nCBT is a type of talk therapy that helps individuals identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to their anxiety. It is based on the idea that our thoughts, feelings, and actions are interconnected, and by changing maladaptive thoughts and behaviors, we can reduce anxiety. CBT typically involves learning relaxation techniques, identifying and challenging negative thoughts, and gradually exposing oneself to situations that trigger anxiety.\nAttention control, on the other hand, is a technique that involves training individuals to focus their attention on specific stimuli or tasks in order to reduce anxiety. This approach is based on the idea that individuals with anxiety disorders have difficulty regulating their attention, and that by learning to control their attention, they can reduce their anxiety. Attention control techniques can include mindfulness meditation, deep breathing exercises, and visualization exercises.\nResearch suggests that both CBT and attention control can be effective in reducing anxiety in children and adolescents. A 2017 meta-analysis published in the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology found that CBT was effective in reducing symptoms of anxiety in children and adolescents, with a large effect size. Another study published in the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry in 2018 found that attention control training was also effective in reducing symptoms of anxiety in children and adolescents.\nIt's important to note that every individual is unique, and what works best for one person may not work for another. It's possible that some children and adolescents may respond better to CBT, while others may respond better to attention control. It's also possible that a combination of both approaches may be most effective.\nIt's important to consult with a qualified mental health professional to determine the best course of treatment for a child or adolescent with an anxiety disorder. They can help determine which approach is most appropriate based on the individual's specific needs and circumstances.",

Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests routine testing may reduce the number of infections and mortality among residents. Reviewers rated all other available evidence as very low certainty. Given the paucity of moderate\u2010 to high\u2010certainty evidence, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions.",

Reduced transmission of COVID-19 within facilities, as a result of measures such as screening visitors, monitoring residents and staff for symptoms, and isolating or quarantining those who test positive.\n2. Improved early detection and response to COVID-19 outbreaks, allowing for quicker implementation of control measures and reduced spread of the virus.\n3. Enhanced infection control practices, such as increased hand hygiene and personal protective equipment (PPE) use, which can help prevent the spread of COVID-19 and other infections.\n4. Reduced number of hospitalizations and deaths among LTCF residents, as a result of early detection and treatment of COVID-19 cases.\n5. Improved preparedness and response to future outbreaks, as facilities learn from their experiences and continue to refine their infection control protocols.\n6. Economic impact, such as increased costs associated with testing, contact tracing, and staffing, which can be significant but are necessary to protect the vulnerable population in LTCFs.\n7. Psychological impact on residents, staff, and families, such as anxiety, fear, and feelings of isolation, which can be mitigated with supportive measures and clear communication.\n8. Changes in visitation policies and restrictions, which can be difficult for families and residents but are necessary to minimize the risk of transmission.\n9. Increased workload and stress for staff, who are critical in implementing and maintaining infection control measures, which can be mitigated with adequate support and resources.\nOverall, COVID-19 surveillance measures in LTCFs have been effective in reducing the transmission of COVID-19 and protecting the vulnerable population, but they also come with some challenges and costs.",

One modeling study provided moderate\u2010certainty evidence that routine testing of staff independent of symptom status would probably reduce hospitalizations among residents and staff. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests routine testing may reduce the number of infections and mortality among residents. Reviewers rated all other available evidence as very low certainty.

Some of the effects of these measures include:\n1. Reduced transmission of COVID-19: Surveillance measures such as screening residents and staff for symptoms, wearing personal protective equipment (PPE), and isolating residents who test positive have helped reduce the transmission of COVID-19 in LTCFs.\n2. Improved infection control practices: Surveillance measures have led to improved infection control practices in LTCFs, such as increased hand hygiene, proper cleaning and disinfection, and proper use of PPE.\n3. Enhanced resident safety: By monitoring residents for symptoms and isolating those who test positive, surveillance measures have helped to enhance resident safety and prevent the spread of COVID-19.\n4. Reduced hospitalizations: Surveillance measures have helped to identify residents who may be at risk of severe illness and hospitalization, allowing for early intervention and potentially reducing the number of hospitalizations.\n5. Increased staff awareness: Surveillance measures have increased staff awareness of COVID-19 and its symptoms, leading to improved vigilance and quicker response times in identifying and containing outbreaks.\n6. Reduced stress and anxiety: Surveillance measures have helped to reduce stress and anxiety among residents and staff by providing a sense of security and safety.\n7. Improved preparedness for future outbreaks: The implementation of surveillance measures has helped LTCFs prepare for future outbreaks, by identifying areas for improvement and enhancing their ability to respond quickly and effectively.\nIt is important to note that the effectiveness of surveillance measures in LTCFs can vary depending on factors such as the type and frequency of measures, the level of staff training and compliance, and the population being monitored.",

Improved symptoms: Exercise-based rehabilitation programs can help alleviate symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and pain associated with pulmonary hypertension.\n4. Better quality of life: Exercise-based rehabilitation programs can improve an individual's overall quality of life by reducing stress, improving mood, and increasing their ability to perform daily activities.\n5. Reduced hospitalization rates: Studies have shown that exercise-based rehabilitation programs can reduce hospitalization rates for individuals with pulmonary hypertension.\n6. Improved lung function: Exercise-based rehabilitation programs can help improve lung function and reduce the risk of lung disease progression.\nIt is important to note that exercise-based rehabilitation programs for pulmonary hypertension should be tailored to the individual's specific needs and abilities, and should be supervised by a qualified healthcare professional. Additionally, it is important to note that exercise alone may not be enough to treat pulmonary hypertension, and it should be used in conjunction with other treatments, such as medication, as prescribed by a healthcare professional.",

            "gold_answer": "For children and adults with cystic fibrosis, dornase alfa improves some aspects of lung function and reduces exacerbations, without clearly reducing mortality or requirements for in\u2010patient treatment. Voice alteration and rash were two major adverse events reported. Evidence shows that people with cystic fibrosis who received dornase alfa had better forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ), as assessed over three months (moderate\u2010certainty evidence), six months (high\u2010certainty evidence), and two years (based on 410 participants), with improvements of 7.30%, 5.80%, and 3.24%, respectively (all results on average). There also appeared to be an improvement in forced vital capacity (FVC) with dornase alfa at three months (by 5.1%) but no clear improvement at two years. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that fewer participants receiving dornase alfa had an exacerbation at two years' follow\u2010up (212 vs 274 per 1000 people). However, results for mortality (7 RCTs, 1690 participants), duration of in\u2010patient treatment (1 RCT, 320 participants), and the number of days on IV antibiotics (1 RCT, 320 participants) were very imprecise. Quality of life was assessed for only 19 people. Among the adverse events evaluated, more participants receiving dornase alfa reported voice alteration (105 vs 62 per 1000 people) and rash (52 vs 22 per 1000 people). No clear differences were detected between dornase alfa and placebo for a range of other adverse events; however, several analyses included small numbers of people and results were imprecise .",

            "gold_answer": "For children and adults with cystic fibrosis, dornase alfa improves some aspects of lung function and reduces exacerbations, without clearly reducing mortality or requirements for in\u2010patient treatment. Voice alteration and rash were two major adverse events reported. Evidence shows that people with cystic fibrosis who received dornase alfa had better forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ), as assessed over three months (moderate\u2010certainty evidence), six months (high\u2010certainty evidence), and two years (based on 410 participants), with improvements of 7.30%, 5.80%, and 3.24%, respectively (all results on average). There also appeared to be an improvement in forced vital capacity (FVC) with dornase alfa at three months (by 5.1%) but no clear improvement at two years. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that fewer participants receiving dornase alfa had an exacerbation at two years' follow\u2010up (212 vs 274 per 1000 people). However, results for mortality (7 RCTs, 1690 participants), duration of in\u2010patient treatment (1 RCT, 320 participants), and the number of days on IV antibiotics (1 RCT, 320 participants) were very imprecise. Quality of life was assessed for only 19 people. Among the adverse events evaluated, more participants receiving dornase alfa reported voice alteration (105 vs 62 per 1000 people) and rash (52 vs 22 per 1000 people). No clear differences were detected between dornase alfa and placebo for a range of other adverse events; however, several analyses included small numbers of people and results were imprecise .",

            "llm_answer": "Dornase alfa is a medication used to treat cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder that affects the respiratory and digestive systems. It works by breaking down DNA released from dead cells, which can accumulate in the lungs and digestive system, causing inflammation and damage.\nThere have been several clinical trials comparing dornase alfa to placebo for the treatment of cystic fibrosis. These trials have shown that dornase alfa is effective in improving lung function, reducing the frequency of lung infections, and improving overall quality of life for people with cystic fibrosis.\nOne study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that dornase alfa significantly improved lung function in patients with cystic fibrosis, compared to placebo, over a 48-week period. Another study published in the Journal of Cystic Fibrosis found that dornase alfa reduced the frequency of lung infections in patients with cystic fibrosis, compared to placebo, over a 24-week period.\nIt's important to note that while dornase alfa has been shown to be effective in treating cystic fibrosis, it is not a cure for the disease. It is typically used in combination with other medications and therapies to manage the symptoms and slow the progression of the disease.\nIt's also important to note that placebo effects can be powerful, and it's possible that some people may experience improvements in their symptoms while taking a placebo. However, the evidence suggests that dornase alfa is a safe and effective treatment option for people with cystic fibrosis, and it has been approved by regulatory authorities for use in this indication.",

In the case of PE, thrombolytics are used to dissolve the clot that has formed in the lungs. Thrombolytic therapy is usually given intravenously and works quickly to dissolve the clot, which can help to restore blood flow to the lungs and improve symptoms such as shortness of breath and chest pain.\nHeparin, on the other hand, is an anticoagulant medication that works by preventing the formation of new blood clots. It is often used in combination with thrombolytic therapy to prevent the clot from growing larger and to prevent new clots from forming. Heparin is given intravenously or subcutaneously and can take several hours to start working.\nIn terms of efficacy, both thrombolytic therapy and heparin have been shown to be effective in treating PE. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that thrombolytic therapy was more effective than heparin in preventing death and recurrent PE in patients with acute PE. However, thrombolytic therapy also carries a higher risk of bleeding complications compared to heparin.\nIn summary, thrombolytic therapy and heparin are both effective treatments for pulmonary embolism, but they have different mechanisms of action and advantages. Thrombolytic therapy works quickly to dissolve the clot, but carries a higher risk of bleeding complications. Heparin, on the other hand, prevents the formation of new clots, but takes longer to start working. The choice between the two treatments depends on the severity of the PE, the patient's overall health, and other individual factors. It's important to discuss the risks and benefits of each treatment with a healthcare provider to determine the best course of action.",

Reduced malaria incidence: MDA can significantly reduce the number of malaria cases in the population, potentially eliminating malaria as a public health problem in the area.\n2. Reduced malaria transmission: By treating individuals who are infected with malaria parasites, MDA can reduce the number of infectious bites from mosquitoes, thereby reducing malaria transmission.\n3. Reduced malaria-related morbidity and mortality: MDA can help prevent malaria-related illnesses and deaths, particularly among vulnerable populations such as children and pregnant women.\n4. Potential for elimination of malaria reservoir: MDA can potentially eliminate the malaria reservoir in the area, reducing the risk of malaria outbreaks in the future.\n5. Reduced selection pressure on parasites: MDA can reduce the selection pressure on malaria parasites, potentially slowing the emergence of drug-resistant parasites.\n6. Reduced risk of malaria reintroduction: By reducing the number of infected individuals, MDA can reduce the risk of malaria reintroduction into the area.\n7. Improved health outcomes: MDA can improve overall health outcomes in the population, particularly in areas where malaria is a significant public health problem.\n8. Reduced economic burden: MDA can reduce the economic burden of malaria on individuals, families, and communities, particularly in areas where malaria is a significant cause of lost productivity and healthcare expenditure.\nIt is important to note that the effectiveness of MDA in low-endemic areas may be lower compared to areas with higher endemicity, and the optimal frequency and duration of MDA may need to be tailored to the specific context.

Reduced malaria incidence: MDA can significantly reduce the number of malaria cases in the population, as it targets both the parasite and the vector that transmits it.\n2. Reduced malaria transmission: By administering antimalarial drugs to a large proportion of the population, MDA can reduce the number of people infected with malaria, which in turn reduces the number of mosquitoes that can transmit the disease.\n3. Reduced risk of disease spread: MDA can help prevent the spread of malaria to other areas, particularly in regions with low endemicity where the disease may not be well-established.\n4. Reduced disease burden: By reducing the number of malaria cases, MDA can help alleviate the burden on healthcare systems and reduce the economic and social impact of the disease.\n5. Potential for elimination: In areas with very low endemicity, MDA may be used as part of a malaria elimination strategy, with the goal of completely eliminating malaria from the region.\nIt is important to note that MDA should only be implemented in areas where the malaria burden is low, as it may not be effective in areas with high endemicity. Additionally, MDA should be part of a comprehensive malaria control strategy that includes other interventions such as vector control, disease surveillance, and healthcare system strengthening.",

Very low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that nebulized salbutamol every four to six hours within the first three days of life for infants (\u2265 34 weeks of gestation) with transient tachypnea reduces the duration of oxygen supplementation (mean difference \u201019.24 hours) and respiratory support (intermittent positive\u2010pressure ventilation or continuous positive airway pressure; mean difference \u20109.24 hours) when compared with placebo. However, it is unclear whether salbutamol has an effect on the need for continuous positive airway pressure or mechanical ventilation. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests a shorter duration of tachypnea (mean difference \u201016.83 hours) and hospital stay (mean difference \u20101.48 days) with salbutamol. Two low\u2010quality RCTs with few participants reported on initiation of oral feeding, showing a mean difference of \u201028.49 days in favor of salbutamol.

            "gold_answer": "Salbutamol may improve outcomes for newborn infants with transient tachypnea; however, it may have little effect on the need for mechanical ventilation or continuous positive airway pressure. Very low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that nebulized salbutamol every four to six hours within the first three days of life for infants (\u2265 34 weeks of gestation) with transient tachypnea reduces the duration of oxygen supplementation (mean difference \u201019.24 hours) and respiratory support (intermittent positive\u2010pressure ventilation or continuous positive airway pressure; mean difference \u20109.24 hours) when compared with placebo. However, it is unclear whether salbutamol has an effect on the need for continuous positive airway pressure or mechanical ventilation. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests a shorter duration of tachypnea (mean difference \u201016.83 hours) and hospital stay (mean difference \u20101.48 days) with salbutamol. Two low\u2010quality RCTs with few participants reported on initiation of oral feeding, showing a mean difference of \u201028.49 days in favor of salbutamol. Data regarding safety outcomes, including adverse effects of salbutamol such as hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, and cardiac arrhythmia and pulmonary complications, such as persistent pulmonary hypertension or pneumothorax, are scarce.",

It is important to consult a qualified healthcare professional for personalized medical advice and treatment.\nHowever, I want to emphasize the importance of consulting a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment of any medical condition, especially when it comes to newborn infants. Transient tachypnea, also known as transient tachypnea of the newborn, is a common condition that affects newborns and can be caused by a variety of factors. It is important to seek medical attention if your newborn baby experiences rapid breathing, difficulty breathing, or other concerning symptoms.\nA healthcare professional can assess your baby's symptoms, perform any necessary tests, and provide appropriate treatment. They may recommend salbutamol or another medication, depending on the underlying cause of the condition. It is important to follow their recommendations closely and not self-medicate your baby.\nIn general, it is never a good idea to give any medication to a newborn baby without the guidance of a healthcare professional. Newborns are vulnerable and their bodies are still developing, so it is important to ensure that any medication they receive is safe and appropriate for their age and weight.\nIn summary, while I cannot provide medical advice, I strongly recommend consulting a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment of any medical condition in newborn infants.

Moderate\u2010quality evidence showed that this benefit was not sustained in the longer\u2010term (5 years). Low\u2010quality evidence suggests there was no benefit of an adjunctive corticosteroid in terms of reducing rates of disabling neurological deficit, ether within 24 months or at 5 years. There was no apparent impact of adjunctive corticosteroids on the incidences of hepatitis, hyperglycemia/glycosuria, gastrointestinal bleeding, or invasive bacterial infection but event rates were very low meaning conclusions cannot be drawn.",

Studies have consistently demonstrated that corticosteroids reduce the risk of death and disability in patients with tuberculous meningitis, particularly in those with severe disease. The use of corticosteroids has been associated with a significant reduction in mortality rates, from approximately 30-40% in untreated patients to around 10-20% in patients receiving corticosteroids. Additionally, corticosteroids have been shown to reduce the risk of long-term disability, such as hearing loss and cognitive impairment. However, the optimal dosage and duration of corticosteroid therapy for tuberculous meningitis are still uncertain and require further research.",

Moderate\u2010quality evidence showed that this benefit was not sustained in the longer\u2010term (5 years). Low\u2010quality evidence suggests there was no benefit of an adjunctive corticosteroid in terms of reducing rates of disabling neurological deficit, ether within 24 months or at 5 years. There was no apparent impact of adjunctive corticosteroids on the incidences of hepatitis, hyperglycemia/glycosuria, gastrointestinal bleeding, or invasive bacterial infection but event rates were very low meaning conclusions cannot be drawn.",

There is a lack of data on neonatal short\u2010term (early or late sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, neonatal death, hospital stay) and long\u2010term (major neurodevelopmental disability) potential benefits or harms following probiotic administration. None of the trials included women with a previous history of preterm birth, multiple pregnancy, or uterine anomaly. Reviewers did not assess serious adverse maternal or neonatal adverse events following use of probiotics.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "RCT (rct): A study which tests the effectiveness and safety of treatments or procedures as fairly and objectively as possible. By randomly assigning patients to different treatments for the same problem, the results can be assessed equally with the aim of discovering the best possible procedure for the condition.\nPLACEBO (placebo): an inactive substance; a pill/liquid that contains no medicine\nMORBIDITY (morbidity): undesired result or complication\nMORTALITY (mortality): death\nRISK (risk): The chance that an activity or hazard will give rise to harm. Risk is generally given in terms of numerical odds (1 in 10) or percentages (10%).\nSEPSIS (sepsis): The immune system's overreaction to an infection or injury which can lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and death.\nPOTENTIAL (potential): possible\nPOTENTIATE (potentiate): increase or multiply the effect of a drug or toxin (poison) by giving another drug or toxin at the same time (sometimes an unintentional result)\nPOTENTIATOR (potentiator): an agent that helps another agent work better\nASSESS (assess): to learn about, measure, evaluate, look at",

            "llm_answer": "Yes, probiotics administered to pregnant women have been shown to help prevent morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that can help maintain a healthy gut microbiome, which is important for the development and function of various bodily systems, including the immune system.\nStudies have found that probiotics can help reduce the risk of preterm birth, which is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Probiotics have also been shown to reduce the risk of other complications in preterm infants, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious condition that can cause damage to the intestines.\nIt's important to note that not all probiotics are the same, and some strains have been found to be more effective than others in preventing morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. For example, the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any supplements during pregnancy, including probiotics, to ensure safety and effectiveness. Additionally, it's important to note that while probiotics can help reduce the risk of complications, they are not a guarantee against them, and other factors such as proper prenatal care, a healthy diet, and a safe delivery are also important for a healthy pregnancy and baby.",
