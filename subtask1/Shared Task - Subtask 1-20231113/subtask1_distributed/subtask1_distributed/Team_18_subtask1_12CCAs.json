            "gold_answer": "For adults with recent\u2010onset psychosis, specialized early intervention (SEI) for 18 to 24 months is likely to increase chances of recovery, reduce the likelihood and duration of hospital admissions, and reduce disengagement with treatment compared with TAU. More adults with recent\u2010onset psychosis are likely to recover following standard SEI treatment compared with TAU (831 vs 589 per 1000 people; all results on average; low\u2010certainty evidence). Levels of disengagement from treatment are likely to be lower during standard SEI treatment compared with TAU (31 vs 62 per 1000 people; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that hospital admissions are likely to be fewer among participants treated with SEI compared with TAU, and when admitted, SEI recipients are more likely to spend fewer days in hospital compared with TAU participants (mean difference 27 days). Reviewers found no clear differences in rates of relapse after treatment (284 vs 397 per 1000 people), no clear differences in psychotic symptoms, and no differences in all\u2010cause mortality (5 vs 22 per 1000 people); results are based on low\u2010certainty evidence.

            "gold_answer": "Carbamazepine, levetiracetam, and lamotrigine seem to be superior to other antiepileptic drugs and may be suitable for first\u2010line treatment for adults and children with focal epilepsy. Reviewers compared the following antiepileptic drugs for people with focal epilepsy with each other in a network meta\u2010analysis: carbamazepine (CBZ), gabapentin (GBP), lacosamide (LCM), lamotrigine (LTG), levetiracetam (LEV), oxcarbazepine (OXC), phenobarbitone (PHB), phenytoin (PHT), topiramate (TPM), sodium valproate (VPS), and zonisamide (ZNS). Considering CBZ as the comparator, for treatment failure for any reason, LTG and LEV were significantly better than CBZ, and CBZ was significantly better than GBP and PHB. For treatment failure due to adverse events, LTG, LEV, and GBP were significantly better than CBZ, and CBZ was significantly better than PHB. For treatment failure due to lack of efficacy, CBZ was significantly better than GBP and PHB. Considering LTG as the comparator, for treatment failure for any reason, LTG was significantly better than all treatments except for LEV. For treatment failure due to adverse events, LTG was significantly better than VPS, TPM, CBZ, PHT, LCM, and PHB. For treatment failure due to lack of efficacy, LTG was significantly better than GBP and PHB. The certainty of the evidence was high for almost all drugs compared with CBZ and LTG. People had a greater chance of being seizure\u2010free for 12 months with CBZ or OXC than with GBP. Researchers did not report adverse events separately for people with focal and idiopathic generalized tonic\u2010clonic seizures. Across 26 trials, the proportion of people experiencing an adverse event ranged from 76% with TPM to 43% with PHB; the proportion with LEV was unclear. The most commonly reported adverse events were drowsiness or fatigue (most common with CBZ, PHT, VPS, OXC, and GBP), headache or migraine (most common with LTG, LEV, ZNS, and LCM), dizziness or faintness (CBZ, PHT, and LEV), gastrointestinal disturbances (CBZ and PHT), and rash or skin disorders (CBZ and LTG).",

            "gold_answer": "Carbamazepine, levetiracetam, and lamotrigine seem to be superior to other antiepileptic drugs and may be suitable for first\u2010line treatment for adults and children with focal epilepsy. Reviewers compared the following antiepileptic drugs for people with focal epilepsy with each other in a network meta\u2010analysis: carbamazepine (CBZ), gabapentin (GBP), lacosamide (LCM), lamotrigine (LTG), levetiracetam (LEV), oxcarbazepine (OXC), phenobarbitone (PHB), phenytoin (PHT), topiramate (TPM), sodium valproate (VPS), and zonisamide (ZNS). Considering CBZ as the comparator, for treatment failure for any reason, LTG and LEV were significantly better than CBZ, and CBZ was significantly better than GBP and PHB. For treatment failure due to adverse events, LTG, LEV, and GBP were significantly better than CBZ, and CBZ was significantly better than PHB. For treatment failure due to lack of efficacy, CBZ was significantly better than GBP and PHB. Considering LTG as the comparator, for treatment failure for any reason, LTG was significantly better than all treatments except for LEV. For treatment failure due to adverse events, LTG was significantly better than VPS, TPM, CBZ, PHT, LCM, and PHB. For treatment failure due to lack of efficacy, LTG was significantly better than GBP and PHB. The certainty of the evidence was high for almost all drugs compared with CBZ and LTG. People had a greater chance of being seizure\u2010free for 12 months with CBZ or OXC than with GBP. Researchers did not report adverse events separately for people with focal and idiopathic generalized tonic\u2010clonic seizures. Across 26 trials, the proportion of people experiencing an adverse event ranged from 76% with TPM to 43% with PHB; the proportion with LEV was unclear. The most commonly reported adverse events were drowsiness or fatigue (most common with CBZ, PHT, VPS, OXC, and GBP), headache or migraine (most common with LTG, LEV, ZNS, and LCM), dizziness or faintness (CBZ, PHT, and LEV), gastrointestinal disturbances (CBZ and PHT), and rash or skin disorders (CBZ and LTG).",

            "llm_answer": "Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) can be effective in managing focal epilepsy, which is a type of epilepsy that affects only one part of the brain. The choice of AED depends on various factors, including the type and severity of seizures, the patient's age, health status, and other medical conditions.\nSome AEDs are more commonly used to treat focal epilepsy than others. Levetiracetam (Keppra) and lacosamide (Vimpat) are two popular options that have been shown to be effective in clinical trials for focal seizures. Other AEDs that may be used for focal epilepsy include carbamazepine (Tegretol), valproate (Depakote), and lamotrigine (Lamictal).\nIt's important to note that each person's response to AEDs can vary, and it may take some trial and error to find the right medication and dosage. It's also important to work closely with a healthcare provider to monitor the effectiveness and side effects of the medication.\nIt's not appropriate to make a direct comparison between AEDs for people with focal epilepsy, as each person's experience can vary and the most effective medication can depend on individual factors.

For people with enteric fever, cefixime may result in worse clinical outcomes (i.e. clinical failure, relapse of infection, and longer time to defervescence), and ceftriaxone may lead to a longer hospital stay, when compared with fluoroquinolones (ofloxacin, gatifloxacin, or ciprofloxacin). Ceftriaxone may shorten time to defervescence compared with azithromycin. However, most of the available evidence is of low to very low certainty and comes from old studies, thereby precluding a reliable answer to this clinical question.",

Compared to other antimicrobials, cephalosporins have several advantages, including:\n* Broad-spectrum activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Salmonella and other enteric fever pathogens\n* Higher efficacy in treating severe and complicated enteric fever cases\n* Lower risk of resistance development compared to other antimicrobials\n* Good tolerability and safety profile\n* Convenient dosing regimens\nHowever, cephalosporins may have some disadvantages, such as higher cost and potential interactions with other medications. Other antimicrobials that may be used to treat enteric fever include fluoroquinolones, azithromycin, and amoxicillin. The choice of antimicrobial depends on various factors, including the severity and location of the infection, the patient's age, health status, and other medical conditions, as well as local antimicrobial resistance patterns.

For people with enteric fever, cefixime may result in worse clinical outcomes (i.e. clinical failure, relapse of infection, and longer time to defervescence), and ceftriaxone may lead to a longer hospital stay, when compared with fluoroquinolones (ofloxacin, gatifloxacin, or ciprofloxacin). Ceftriaxone may shorten time to defervescence compared with azithromycin. However, most of the available evidence is of low to very low certainty and comes from old studies, thereby precluding a reliable answer to this clinical question.",

            "llm_answer": "Cephalosporins are a class of antibiotics that are effective against a wide range of bacterial infections, including enteric fever. However, the choice of antimicrobial agent for enteric fever depends on various factors, such as the severity of the infection, the patient's age, underlying health conditions, and the likely causative organism.\nCephalosporins are generally considered effective against Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi, which is the most common cause of enteric fever. However, the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of S. Typhi has reduced the effectiveness of cephalosporins in some regions.\nIn comparison to other antimicrobials, cephalosporins have several advantages and disadvantages. Advantages include their broad-spectrum activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, their ability to penetrate tissues and body fluids, and their relatively low risk of toxicity. Disadvantages include the risk of allergic reactions, the potential for Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea, and the development of resistance.\nOther antimicrobials that may be used to treat enteric fever include fluoroquinolones, macrolides, and aminoglycosides. The choice of antimicrobial agent depends on various factors, including the severity of the infection, the patient's medical history, and the local antibiotic resistance patterns.\nIt's important to note that antibiotics should only be prescribed by a qualified healthcare professional, and patients should adhere to the recommended treatment regimen to ensure effective treatment and minimize the risk of antibiotic resistance.",

However, moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that risk of adverse events is higher with immediate treatment (506 vs 308 per 1000 people). The result for mortality was imprecise.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "PLACEBO (placebo): an inactive substance; a pill/liquid that contains no medicine\nRISK (risk): The chance that an activity or hazard will give rise to harm.

A healthcare professional should carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks before making a decision.",

However, moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that risk of adverse events is higher with immediate treatment (506 vs 308 per 1000 people). The result for mortality was imprecise.",

            "llm_answer": "Prescribing an antiepileptic drug immediately after a first unprovoked seizure can have both benefits and risks.\nBenefits:\n1. Reduced risk of recurrent seizures: Antiepileptic drugs can help prevent future seizures, which can reduce the risk of injury, cognitive impairment, and other complications associated with recurrent seizures.\n2. Faster seizure control: Early treatment with antiepileptic drugs may help achieve seizure control faster, which can improve the patient's quality of life and reduce the risk of long-term cognitive and social impairments.\n3. Better management of seizure clusters: In some cases, prescribing an antiepileptic drug immediately after a first unprovoked seizure may help manage seizure clusters, which can reduce the risk of status epilepticus, a potentially life-threatening condition.\nRisks:\n1. Adverse reactions: Antiepileptic drugs can have side effects, such as drowsiness, dizziness, and gastrointestinal problems, which can impact the patient's quality of life and daily activities.\n2. Drug interactions: Antiepileptic drugs can interact with other medications the patient is taking, which can increase the risk of adverse reactions or reduce the effectiveness of the medications.\n3. Unknown long-term effects: The long-term effects of antiepileptic drugs on the brain and other organs are not fully understood, and there is a risk of unknown long-term side effects, especially in children and adolescents.\n4. Over-medication: Prescribing an antiepileptic drug immediately after a first unprovoked seizure may lead to over-medication, as the seizure may have been a one-time event and may not recur.\n5. Cost and accessibility: Antiepileptic drugs can be expensive, and accessibility may be a concern for some patients, particularly in low-income countries or regions.\nIn conclusion, prescribing an antiepileptic drug immediately after a first unprovoked seizure can have both benefits and ris",

COPD is a chronic condition that cannot be cured, but it can be managed with medication and lifestyle changes. Prophylactic antibiotics are only recommended for certain conditions, such as before dental procedures or in cases of severe acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) that require hospitalization.\nIt's important to note that antibiotics should only be used when necessary and under the guidance of a healthcare professional. Overuse or misuse of antibiotics can lead to antibiotic resistance, which can make infections harder to treat in the future.\nInstead of prophylactic antibiotics, the recommended treatment for COPD includes:\n1. Quitting smoking: Smoking is the leading cause of COPD, and quitting can help slow the progression of the disease.\n2. Medications: Bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors are commonly used to manage COPD symptoms.\n3. Pulmonary rehabilitation: This includes exercise, education, and support to help manage symptoms and improve quality of life.\n4. Oxygen therapy: For those with severe COPD, oxygen therapy may be necessary to help improve oxygen levels in the blood.\n5. Nutritional support: A healthy diet and supplements may be recommended to help manage symptoms and improve overall health.\nIt's important to work closely with a healthcare professional to develop a personalized treatment plan that's tailored to your specific needs and condition.",

            "gold_answer": "No firm conclusions can be drawn regarding different school dental screening programs for improving oral health, as available evidence is of low to very low certainty. Low\u2010 to very low\u2010certainty evidence suggests little to no improvement in dental attendance and in the prevalence of caries and other untreated oral health needs or dental diseases when criteria\u2010based screenings are provided compared with when no screenings or traditional screenings are provided. Comparison of traditional screening versus no screening yields inconsistent and very uncertain results. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that criteria\u2010based screening with specific referral and traditional\u2010based screening with motivation result in better dental attendance compared with screenings alone (without specific referral or motivation). On average, from 174 to 208 more children visited a dentist or an orthodontist. However, it must be noted that similar results may have been found had these same interventions of specific referral or motivation been compared to no screenings alone, or had they not been combined with screening as well (i.e. specific referral and motivation each vs no screening). Other comparisons of interventions in combination with dental screenings (referral letter based on common\u2010sense model plus dental information guide vs standard referral letter and common\u2010sense model referral letter plus dental information guide vs common\u2010sense model referral letter, referral to specific treatment facility vs advice letter to see a dentist) have led to unclear results, as only very low\u2010certainty evidence is available. No studies have reported on adverse events.",

            "llm_answer": "Different school dental screening programs can vary in their effectiveness in improving oral health outcomes. Some programs may focus on visual examinations, while others may include more comprehensive screenings, such as radiographs and fluoride applications. Studies have shown that programs that include a combination of screening and preventive measures, such as fluoride varnish application and education on proper oral hygiene, have a greater impact on improving oral health outcomes compared to visual examinations alone. Additionally, programs that have a higher frequency of screening and follow-up visits tend to be more effective in reducing dental caries and improving oral health. Ultimately, the most effective school dental screening program will depend on various factors, including the population being served, available resources, and the specific goals of the program.",

            "gold_answer": "No firm conclusions can be drawn regarding different school dental screening programs for improving oral health, as available evidence is of low to very low certainty. Low\u2010 to very low\u2010certainty evidence suggests little to no improvement in dental attendance and in the prevalence of caries and other untreated oral health needs or dental diseases when criteria\u2010based screenings are provided compared with when no screenings or traditional screenings are provided. Comparison of traditional screening versus no screening yields inconsistent and very uncertain results. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that criteria\u2010based screening with specific referral and traditional\u2010based screening with motivation result in better dental attendance compared with screenings alone (without specific referral or motivation). On average, from 174 to 208 more children visited a dentist or an orthodontist. However, it must be noted that similar results may have been found had these same interventions of specific referral or motivation been compared to no screenings alone, or had they not been combined with screening as well (i.e. specific referral and motivation each vs no screening). Other comparisons of interventions in combination with dental screenings (referral letter based on common\u2010sense model plus dental information guide vs standard referral letter and common\u2010sense model referral letter plus dental information guide vs common\u2010sense model referral letter, referral to specific treatment facility vs advice letter to see a dentist) have led to unclear results, as only very low\u2010certainty evidence is available. No studies have reported on adverse events.",

            "llm_answer": "Different school dental screening programs can vary in their effectiveness in improving oral health, depending on several factors such as the screening method, frequency, and follow-up care.\nSome studies have shown that visual examination-based screening programs, which are the most common method used in schools, can identify dental problems and reduce the prevalence of dental caries (cavities) and gingivitis (gum disease) among children. However, these programs may not be as effective in detecting early stages of dental problems, and may not provide adequate follow-up care for children who are identified as having dental issues.\nIn contrast, screening programs that use more advanced methods, such as dental radiographs (X-rays) or salivary diagnostics, may be more effective in detecting early stages of dental problems and providing appropriate follow-up care. However, these methods may be more expensive and require more specialized equipment and training, which can limit their implementation in some schools.\nAdditionally, some school dental screening programs may focus on prevention and education, such as providing fluoride varnish applications, oral hygiene instruction, and nutrition counseling. These programs may be more effective in preventing dental problems and promoting good oral health habits among children, but may require more resources and commitment from schools and parents.\nOverall, the effectiveness of school dental screening programs in improving oral health can vary depending on several factors, and there is no one-size-fits-all solution. The most effective approach may be a combination of different methods and strategies tailored to the specific needs of each school and community. It's important for schools to consult with dental professionals and experts to determine the best approach for their specific program.",

            "llm_answer": "I am not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on the topic. Adjunct biological therapy, also known as targeted therapy, is a type of cancer treatment that uses drugs or other substances to target specific molecules or pathways that are involved in the growth and spread of cancer cells.\nFor people with advanced gastric and esophago-gastric junction adenocarcinoma receiving second-line chemotherapy, adjunct biological therapy may be used in combination with chemotherapy to improve treatment outcomes. Some biological therapies that may be used in this context include:\n1. Trastuzumab: This drug targets the HER2 protein, which is overexpressed in some gastric and esophageal cancers. Trastuzumab has been shown to improve survival and decrease the risk of disease progression in patients with HER2-positive gastric and esophageal cancer.\n2. Ramucirumab: This drug targets vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), which is involved in the formation of new blood vessels that feed tumors. Ramucirumab has been shown to improve progression-free survival and overall survival in patients with advanced gastric and esophageal cancer.\n3. Nivolumab: This drug is an immune checkpoint inhibitor that works by blocking a protein called PD-1, which is found on the surface of immune cells. By blocking PD-1, nivolumab helps to restore the immune system's ability to recognize and attack cancer cells. Nivolumab has been shown to have antitumor activity in patients with advanced gastric and esophageal cancer.\nIt's important to note that the use of adjunct biological therapy in gastric and esophageal cancer is still an area of active research, and not all patients may be eligible for this type of treatment. Patients should discuss their individual treatment options with their healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for their specific situation.",

            "gold_answer": "For people with resistant hypertension, renal denervation probably improves blood pressure but may have little to no effect on major cardiovascular outcomes. Compared with a sham procedure, proximal ablation, or antihypertensive medications in people with resistant hypertension, renal denervation may have little to no effect on the incidence of myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or ischemic stroke (all three low\u2010certainty evidence); or on mortality or hypertensive crisis, as event rates were very low in both groups. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that renal denervation probably leads to lower 24\u2010hour ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring (by 5.29 mmHg for systolic BP and 3.75 mmHg for diastolic BP; all results on average) and to lower diastolic office BP (by 4.61 mmHg), but probably has little to no effect on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)/creatinine clearance. Bradycardia was assessed in only 220 participants, but RCTs suggest that this may be increased with renal denervation (9% across denervation groups experienced bradycardia). Withdrawals due to adverse events ranged from 0% to 17% with renal denervation versus 0% to 62% with the control intervention. The results on hospitalization were uncertain, and quality of life was assessed in a single RCT with 17 participants.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "HYPERTENSION (hypertension): high blood pressure\nRENAL (renal): pertaining to the kidneys\nPROXIMAL (proximal): closer to the center of the body, away from the end\nMYOCARDIAL (myocardial): pertaining to the heart muscle\nINFARCT (infarct): death of tissue due to lack of blood supply\nANGINA (angina): pain resulting from not enough blood flowing to the heart\nMORTALITY (mortality): death\nAMBULATORY (ambulatory): walk, able to walk\nMONITOR (monitor): check on; keep track of; watch carefully\nSYSTOLIC (systolic): top number in blood pressure; pressure during active contraction of the heart\nDIASTOLIC (diastolic): lower number in a blood pressure reading\nBRADYCARDIA (bradycardia): slow heartbeat\nASSESS (assess): to learn about, measure, evaluate, look at\nRCT (rct): A study which tests the effectiveness and safety of treatments or procedures as fairly and objectively as possible.

            "llm_answer": "Renal denervation, a minimally invasive procedure that targets the nerves in the kidneys, has been shown to have several effects on people with resistant hypertension, including:\n1. Blood pressure reduction: Renal denervation has been shown to significantly reduce blood pressure in people with resistant hypertension, with some studies reporting average reductions of 30-40 mmHg in systolic pressure and 15-20 mmHg in diastolic pressure.\n2. Improved blood pressure control: Renal denervation can help improve blood pressure control in people with resistant hypertension, with some studies reporting that up to 70% of patients achieved blood pressure control after the procedure.\n3. Reduced need for medication: Renal denervation may reduce the need for blood pressure medication in some people with resistant hypertension, as the procedure can help the body regulate blood pressure more effectively.\n4. Improved cardiovascular health: By reducing blood pressure, renal denervation may also help improve cardiovascular health in people with resistant hypertension, reducing the risk of complications such as heart disease, stroke, and heart failure.\n5. Minimally invasive: Renal denervation is a minimally invasive procedure, typically performed through a small incision in the groin, which can reduce the risk of complications compared to more invasive surgical procedures.\nIt is important to note that while renal denervation can be an effective treatment for resistant hypertension, it is not suitable for everyone and should only be considered for patients who have tried multiple medications and lifestyle changes without success. Additionally, the long-term effects of renal denervation are still being studied, and it is important to discuss the potential benefits and risks with a healthcare provider to determine if it is the right treatment option.",

            "gold_answer": "For people with resistant hypertension, renal denervation probably improves blood pressure but may have little to no effect on major cardiovascular outcomes. Compared with a sham procedure, proximal ablation, or antihypertensive medications in people with resistant hypertension, renal denervation may have little to no effect on the incidence of myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or ischemic stroke (all three low\u2010certainty evidence); or on mortality or hypertensive crisis, as event rates were very low in both groups. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that renal denervation probably leads to lower 24\u2010hour ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring (by 5.29 mmHg for systolic BP and 3.75 mmHg for diastolic BP; all results on average) and to lower diastolic office BP (by 4.61 mmHg), but probably has little to no effect on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)/creatinine clearance. Bradycardia was assessed in only 220 participants, but RCTs suggest that this may be increased with renal denervation (9% across denervation groups experienced bradycardia). Withdrawals due to adverse events ranged from 0% to 17% with renal denervation versus 0% to 62% with the control intervention. The results on hospitalization were uncertain, and quality of life was assessed in a single RCT with 17 participants.",

            "llm_answer": "Renal denervation is a minimally invasive procedure that involves disrupting the nerves that run from the kidneys to the brain. It is sometimes used to treat resistant hypertension, which is high blood pressure that is not controlled by medication.\nThe effects of renal denervation for people with resistant hypertension can include:\n* Lower blood pressure: Renal denervation has been shown to lower blood pressure in people with resistant hypertension. Studies have shown that blood pressure can be reduced by an average of 30-40 mmHg.\n* Reduced risk of cardiovascular events: High blood pressure is a major risk factor for cardiovascular events such as heart attacks, strokes, and heart failure. By lowering blood pressure, renal denervation may reduce the risk of these events.\n* Improved quality of life: Renal denervation can improve a person's quality of life by reducing the symptoms of high blood pressure, such as headaches, dizziness, and shortness of breath.\n* Potential risks and complications: Renal denervation is generally considered safe, but as with any medical procedure, there are potential risks and complications. These can include bleeding, infection, and damage to surrounding tissues or organs.\nIt is important to note that renal denervation is not suitable for everyone with resistant hypertension, and the decision to undergo the procedure should be made on a case-by-case basis with the guidance of a healthcare professional. Additionally, renal denervation is not a cure for high blood pressure, and it is important to continue taking medication as prescribed and making lifestyle changes to manage blood pressure.",

            "gold_answer": "The effects of different interventions for treating medication\u2010related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) are unclear, as only low\u2010 to very low\u2010certainty evidence is available. Reviewers assessed several different comparisons for treating MRONJ. For all comparisons, neither intervention seemed to be superior to the other with regard to healing of MRONJ; however, only a single small trial was performed for each comparison. For the effects of different interventions for preventing MRONJ, see CCA 4199 .",

            "llm_answer": "Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) is a serious condition that can occur as a side effect of certain medications, such as bisphosphonates and denosumab. Treatment for MRONJ typically involves a combination of supportive care, medication management, and surgical interventions.\nThe effects of interventions for treating MRONJ can vary depending on the severity of the condition and the individual patient's response to treatment. Some possible effects of interventions include:\n1. Pain relief: Pain management is a key aspect of treating MRONJ. Medications such as analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs may be prescribed to help manage pain and discomfort.\n2. Improved mobility: Physical therapy and rehabilitation may be recommended to help improve mobility and reduce the risk of further bone damage.\n3. Enhanced bone healing: Bisphosphonates and other medications may be used to promote bone healing and prevent further bone loss.\n4. Reduced risk of infection: Antibiotics may be prescribed to prevent or treat infections that can occur in the affected bone.\n5. Improved overall health: Treating underlying medical conditions, such as osteoporosis or cancer, can help reduce the risk of developing MRONJ.\n6. Surgical interventions: In severe cases of MRONJ, surgery may be necessary to repair or remove affected bone tissue.\nIt's important to note that the effectiveness of interventions for MRONJ can vary depending on the individual patient and the severity of the condition. It's important to work closely with a healthcare provider to develop a personalized treatment plan and monitor progress.",

Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that can help maintain a healthy gut microbiome, which is important for the development and function of various bodily systems, including the immune system.\nStudies have found that probiotics can help reduce the risk of preterm birth, which is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Probiotics have also been shown to reduce the risk of other complications in preterm infants, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious condition that can cause damage to the intestines.\nIt's important to note that not all probiotics are the same, and some strains have been found to be more effective than others in preventing morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. For example, the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any supplements during pregnancy, including probiotics, to ensure safety and effectiveness. Additionally, it's important to note that while probiotics can help reduce the risk of complications, they are not a guarantee against them, and other factors such as proper prenatal care, a healthy diet, and a safe delivery are also important for a healthy pregnancy and baby.",
