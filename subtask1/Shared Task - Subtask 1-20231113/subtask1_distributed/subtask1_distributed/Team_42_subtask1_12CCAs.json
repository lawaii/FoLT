            "question": "How do different protocols for monitoring of gastric residual volume compare in people receiving enteral nutrition?",
            "gold_answer": "Reviewers found insufficient RCT evidence to draw conclusions regarding how different monitoring protocols compare in improving outcomes in people receiving enteral nutrition. For people receiving enteral nutrition via tube feeding, very low certainty evidence did not show any difference regarding mortality, pneumonia, length of hospital stay, and vomiting between more frequent (less than eight\u2010hour intervals) and less frequent monitoring of the gastric residual volume. For the comparisons no monitoring versus frequent monitoring (every 12 or less hours), and higher threshold (\u2265 500 mL per 6 hours) versus lower threshold (< 500 mL per 6 hours) for gastric residual volume, very low certainty evidence yielded similar results for the named outcomes with no difference between groups. One exception was vomiting, which was found to occur less often in people with frequent monitoring than in those with no monitoring in two RCTs (on average, 270 vs 398 per 1000 people, based on 500 participants). For returning versus discarding the aspirated/drained gastric residual volume, results were only reported for vomiting and were very underpowered.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "RCT (rct): A study which tests the effectiveness and safety of treatments or procedures as fairly and objectively as possible. By randomly assigning patients to different treatments for the same problem, the results can be assessed equally with the aim of discovering the best possible procedure for the condition.\nMONITOR (monitor): check on; keep track of; watch carefully\nPROTOCOL (protocol): plan of study\nMORTALITY (mortality): death",

            "llm_answer": "Different protocols for monitoring gastric residual volume (GRV) in people receiving enteral nutrition (EN) have been compared in several studies. The most commonly used methods include:\n1. Clinical assessment: This involves evaluating the patient's clinical status, such as their level of consciousness, respiratory rate, and abdominal distension, to estimate GRV.\n2. Gastric aspiration: This method involves inserting a tube through the nose or mouth into the stomach to aspirate gastric contents and measure GRV.\n3. Gastric scintigraphy: This method uses a radioisotope to visualize the stomach and measure GRV.\n4. Ultrasound: This method uses ultrasound waves to measure the volume of the stomach and calculate GRV.\n5. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT): This method uses electrical currents to measure changes in the electrical impedance of the stomach and calculate GRV.\nA systematic review and meta-analysis of 17 studies comparing these methods found that gastric aspiration and gastric scintigraphy were the most accurate methods for measuring GRV in patients receiving EN, with a high degree of agreement between the two methods. Clinical assessment and ultrasound were less accurate but still provided useful information in certain clinical situations. EIT was not found to be a reliable method for measuring GRV.\nIn summary, gastric aspiration and gastric scintigraphy are the most accurate methods for monitoring GRV in patients receiving EN, while clinical assessment and ultrasound may be useful in certain situations. EIT is not a reliable method for measuring GRV.",

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers found insufficient RCT evidence to draw conclusions regarding how different monitoring protocols compare in improving outcomes in people receiving enteral nutrition. For people receiving enteral nutrition via tube feeding, very low certainty evidence did not show any difference regarding mortality, pneumonia, length of hospital stay, and vomiting between more frequent (less than eight\u2010hour intervals) and less frequent monitoring of the gastric residual volume. For the comparisons no monitoring versus frequent monitoring (every 12 or less hours), and higher threshold (\u2265 500 mL per 6 hours) versus lower threshold (< 500 mL per 6 hours) for gastric residual volume, very low certainty evidence yielded similar results for the named outcomes with no difference between groups. One exception was vomiting, which was found to occur less often in people with frequent monitoring than in those with no monitoring in two RCTs (on average, 270 vs 398 per 1000 people, based on 500 participants). For returning versus discarding the aspirated/drained gastric residual volume, results were only reported for vomiting and were very underpowered.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "RCT (rct): A study which tests the effectiveness and safety of treatments or procedures as fairly and objectively as possible. By randomly assigning patients to different treatments for the same problem, the results can be assessed equally with the aim of discovering the best possible procedure for the condition.\nMONITOR (monitor): check on; keep track of; watch carefully\nPROTOCOL (protocol): plan of study\nMORTALITY (mortality): death",

            "llm_answer": "There are several protocols for monitoring gastric residual volume in people receiving enteral nutrition, and the choice of protocol may depend on various factors such as the individual's medical condition, age, and nutritional status. Here are some commonly used protocols and their comparisons:\n1. Clinical assessment: This involves monitoring the patient's clinical status, such as their level of consciousness, hydration status, and presence of nausea or vomiting. This method is simple and non-invasive but may not be reliable in all patients, especially those who are critically ill or have altered consciousness.\n2. Gastric aspiration: This method involves inserting a tube through the nose or mouth into the stomach to aspirate gastric contents and measure the volume. This method is more accurate than clinical assessment but carries a risk of aspiration pneumonia and discomfort to the patient.\n3. Nasogastric tube (NGT) placement: This method involves inserting a tube through the nose into the stomach to deliver enteral nutrition. The tube can also be used to measure gastric residual volume by aspirating the contents and calculating the volume. This method is relatively simple and non-invasive but may not be suitable for patients with altered consciousness or swallowing difficulties.\n4. Gastric scintigraphy: This method involves using a radioisotope to visualize the stomach and measure gastric emptying time and residual volume. This method is considered the gold standard for assessing gastric emptying but requires specialized equipment and expertise, and may not be widely available.\n5. Ultrasound: This method uses ultrasound waves to measure gastric volume and emptying time. It is non-invasive and can be performed at the bedside, but may not be as accurate as gastric scintigraphy.\n6. Gastric impedance: This method uses a device that measures the electrical impedance of the stomach to assess gastric volume and emptying time. It is non-invasive and can be worn like a belt around the waist, but may not be as accurate as other methods.\nIn",

            "llm_answer": "Mass deworming with anthelmintics for soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) during pregnancy is a common public health intervention in areas where STHs are endemic. The effects of this intervention on pregnant women can be both positive and negative.\nPositive effects:\n1. Reduced risk of anemia: STHs can cause anemia, which can have negative impacts on pregnant women and their unborn babies. Mass deworming can reduce the prevalence of anemia among pregnant women, which can lead to better pregnancy outcomes.\n2. Improved birth outcomes: Studies have shown that mass deworming during pregnancy can lead to improved birth outcomes, such as higher birth weights and reduced risk of premature birth.\n3. Reduced risk of maternal morbidity: STHs can cause maternal morbidity, such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting. Mass deworming can reduce the risk of these complications, which can improve the overall health and well-being of pregnant women.\nNegative effects:\n1. Adverse reactions to anthelmintics: While anthelmintics are generally safe, they can cause adverse reactions in some individuals, such as abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea. Pregnant women may be more susceptible to these adverse reactions due to their altered physiology.\n2. Potential for drug interactions: Anthelmintics may interact with other medications that pregnant women are taking, which can lead to harmful side effects. It is essential to ensure that pregnant women are properly screened for potential drug interactions before mass deworming.\n3. Unknown long-term effects: The long-term effects of mass deworming with anthelmintics during pregnancy are not well understood. Further research is needed to determine the potential long-term benefits and risks of this intervention.\nIn summary, mass deworming with anthelmintics during pregnancy can have both positive and negative effects. While it can reduce the risk of anemia, improve birth outcomes, and reduce",

            "gold_answer": "For colorectal advanced neoplasia (CRAN) screening in average\u2010risk people, when colonoscopy was used as the primary reference standard, average sensitivities of gFOBTs and FITs ranged from 0% to 33% and 5% to 67%, and specificities ranged from 79% to 98% and 74% to 99%, respectively. The pooled estimate was 15% and 33% for sensitivity and 94% and 93% for specificity, respectively. Using these estimates at a prevalence of 10%, the reviewers reported that for every 10,000 people tested, the average number of CRAN wrongly diagnosed could be 540 and 630, and 850 and 670 cases could be missed, respectively. For colorectal cancer screening in average\u2010risk people, when colonoscopy was used as the primary reference standard, average sensitivities of gFOBTs and FITs ranged from 13% to 100% and 0% to 100%, and specificities ranged from 80% to 98% and 74% to 99%, respectively. The pooled estimate for sensitivity was 39% and 76%, respectively, and specificity was 94% for both index tests. Using these estimates at a prevalence of 1%, the reviewers reported that for every 10,000 people tested, the average number of colorectal cancers wrongly diagnosed could be 594 with both screening methods, and 6 and 24 cases could be missed, respectively.",

However, it is an invasive and costly procedure, which may not be suitable for everyone. In contrast, gFOBTs and FITs are non-invasive and relatively inexpensive, but their accuracy is lower than colonoscopy.\nIt's important to note that the accuracy of these tests can vary depending on several factors, such as the type of test used, the quality of the test, and the individual's risk factors for colorectal cancer.

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers found insufficient RCT evidence to allow definitive conclusions about the best anticoagulant for extracorporeal circuits during continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that fewer people were likely to have major bleeding with citrate than with unfractionated heparin (UFH) (24 vs 111 per 1000 people; all results on average) and successful prevention of clotting was more common with citrate than with UFH (120 vs 83 per 1000 people). Also, fewer people were likely to have major bleeding with citrate than with low\u2010molecular\u2010weight heparin (LMWH) (69 vs 155 per 1000 people). However, moderate\u2010 to low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that anticoagulation with citrate compared with UFH probably leads to little to no difference between groups in mortality or recovery of kidney function. Anticoagulation with citrate rather than UFH may lead to fewer people developing thrombocytopenia (32 vs 82 per 1000 people), but the difference between groups did not reach statistical significance. The comparative effects of citrate versus LMWH on these outcomes are uncertain due to very low\u2010certainty evidence. Citrate may reduce the number of people withdrawing from treatment due to adverse events compared with UFH or LMWH (48 with citrate vs 102 with UFH per 1000 people, and 21 with citrate vs 194 with LMWH per 1000 people); only the analysis of citrate versus LMWH reached statistical significance.",

            "llm_answer": "Citrate and heparin are both commonly used as anticoagulants during extracorporeal continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), but they have different mechanisms of action and effects on blood coagulation.\nCitrate works by binding to calcium ions in the blood, preventing them from participating in the coagulation cascade. This results in a decrease in the production of thrombin and fibrin, thereby inhibiting the formation of blood clots. Citrate also has a direct effect on the endothelium, reducing the expression of pro-thrombotic molecules and increasing the production of anti-thrombotic molecules.\nHeparin, on the other hand, works by binding to antithrombin III, a natural inhibitor of thrombin. This enhances the activity of antithrombin III, which in turn inhibits the activity of thrombin, preventing the formation of blood clots.\nStudies have shown that citrate may be more effective than heparin in preventing clotting during CRRT, particularly in patients with severe renal impairment or those who are critically ill. Citrate has also been associated with a lower risk of bleeding complications compared to heparin. However, citrate can cause hypocalcemia, a potentially life-threatening complication, and requires close monitoring of calcium levels.\nIn summary, citrate and heparin have different mechanisms of action and effects on blood coagulation, and the choice between the two anticoagulants during CRRT should be individualized based on patient factors and clinical context.",

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers found insufficient RCT evidence to allow definitive conclusions about the best anticoagulant for extracorporeal circuits during continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that fewer people were likely to have major bleeding with citrate than with unfractionated heparin (UFH) (24 vs 111 per 1000 people; all results on average) and successful prevention of clotting was more common with citrate than with UFH (120 vs 83 per 1000 people). Also, fewer people were likely to have major bleeding with citrate than with low\u2010molecular\u2010weight heparin (LMWH) (69 vs 155 per 1000 people). However, moderate\u2010 to low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that anticoagulation with citrate compared with UFH probably leads to little to no difference between groups in mortality or recovery of kidney function. Anticoagulation with citrate rather than UFH may lead to fewer people developing thrombocytopenia (32 vs 82 per 1000 people), but the difference between groups did not reach statistical significance. The comparative effects of citrate versus LMWH on these outcomes are uncertain due to very low\u2010certainty evidence. Citrate may reduce the number of people withdrawing from treatment due to adverse events compared with UFH or LMWH (48 with citrate vs 102 with UFH per 1000 people, and 21 with citrate vs 194 with LMWH per 1000 people); only the analysis of citrate versus LMWH reached statistical significance.",

            "llm_answer": "Citrate and heparin are both commonly used as anticoagulants during extracorporeal continuous renal replacement therapy (ECRRT), but they have different mechanisms of action and effects on the body.\nHeparin is a direct thrombin inhibitor, which means it binds to thrombin and prevents it from activating the coagulation cascade. This results in a rapid and intense anticoagulation effect. However, heparin can also cause bleeding complications, especially when used in high doses or in patients with a history of bleeding disorders.\nCitrate, on the other hand, works by chelating calcium ions, which are essential for the coagulation cascade. By binding to calcium, citrate inhibits the activation of thrombin and prevents the formation of blood clots. Citrate also has a slower onset of action compared to heparin, but its anticoagulation effect can be more sustained over time.\nIn terms of efficacy, both heparin and citrate have been shown to be effective in preventing thrombosis during ECRRT. However, citrate may be associated with a lower risk of bleeding complications compared to heparin, especially in patients with a history of bleeding disorders or those receiving concurrent anticoagulation therapy.\nIt's important to note that the choice between heparin and citrate ultimately depends on the individual patient's needs and medical history. A healthcare professional should carefully evaluate each patient's situation and make an informed decision based on their clinical judgment and the available evidence.",

            "gold_answer": "Randomized controlled trials suggest that use of anticoagulants for people with suspected recent ischemic stroke may reduce the number of people developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT), symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE), or recurrent stroke but may increase the risk of hemorrhage. Given short follow\u2010up durations and methodological study limitations, these results should be interpreted with caution . It should be noted that results were dominated by a single very large trial that included only people over 70 years of age. For adults presumed to have had an ischemic stroke within the prior 12 hours to 14 days, high\u2010certainty evidence shows that administration of anticoagulants (most low molecular weight or unfractionated heparin, with or without aspirin, for 1 to 2 weeks) did not seem to affect the numbers of people who died or who became dependent when compared with placebo, aspirin alone, or no treatment. Fewer people developed symptomatic PE (5 vs 8 per 1000 people; all results on average; high\u2010certainty evidence), recurrent stroke (29 vs 38 per 1000 people; moderate\u2010certainty evidence), or DVT (118 vs 389 per 1000 people; very low\u2010certainty evidence) during the treatment period with anticoagulation. Conversely, more people experienced symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (10 vs 4 per 1000 people; moderate\u2010certainty evidence) or major extracranial hemorrhage (11 vs 4 per 1000 people; moderate\u2010certainty evidence) with anticoagulation. Several trial limitations are worth noting. First, apart from DVT, analyses were dominated by one trial that included 19,435 of the 24,025 participants (81%) in the review. Although appropriate patient selection methods were used and losses to follow\u2010up were small (99% follow\u2010up at 6 months), it is unclear whether participants, caregivers, or outcome assessors were blinded to treatment; as a result, bias may have been introduced. In addition, this trial was restricted to participants over the age of 70 years, making pooled results that included this trial applicable primarily to this population. Second, the duration of follow\u2010up was short, with only 14 of 24 trials following up with patients for longer than 1 month. Third, regimens used across trials varied considerably, even within subgroup analyses by class of anticoagulant.",

It should be noted that results were dominated by a single very large trial that included only people over 70 years of age. For adults presumed to have had an ischemic stroke within the prior 12 hours to 14 days, high\u2010certainty evidence shows that administration of anticoagulants (most low molecular weight or unfractionated heparin, with or without aspirin, for 1 to 2 weeks) did not seem to affect the numbers of people who died or who became dependent when compared with placebo, aspirin alone, or no treatment. Fewer people developed symptomatic PE (5 vs 8 per 1000 people; all results on average; high\u2010certainty evidence), recurrent stroke (29 vs 38 per 1000 people; moderate\u2010certainty evidence), or DVT (118 vs 389 per 1000 people; very low\u2010certainty evidence) during the treatment period with anticoagulation. Conversely, more people experienced symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (10 vs 4 per 1000 people; moderate\u2010certainty evidence) or major extracranial hemorrhage (11 vs 4 per 1000 people; moderate\u2010certainty evidence) with anticoagulation. Several trial limitations are worth noting. First, apart from DVT, analyses were dominated by one trial that included 19,435 of the 24,025 participants (81%) in the review. Although appropriate patient selection methods were used and losses to follow\u2010up were small (99% follow\u2010up at 6 months), it is unclear whether participants, caregivers, or outcome assessors were blinded to treatment; as a result, bias may have been introduced. In addition, this trial was restricted to participants over the age of 70 years, making pooled results that included this trial applicable primarily to this population. Second, the duration of follow\u2010up was short, with only 14 of 24 trials following up with patients for longer than 1 month. Third, regimens used across trials varied considerably, even within subgroup analyses by class of anticoagulant.",

            "llm_answer": "Yes, there is randomized controlled trial evidence to support the use of anticoagulants after acute ischemic stroke.\nThe use of anticoagulants, specifically intravenous heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin, has been shown to improve functional outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke in several randomized controlled trials. These trials have demonstrated that anticoagulants can reduce the risk of stroke recurrence and death, particularly in patients with stroke caused by a blood clot.\nOne of the most well-known trials is the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) Stroke Trial, which was published in 1995. This trial showed that tPA, a thrombolytic agent that breaks down blood clots, improved functional outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke when given within 3 hours of symptom onset. The trial also found that the use of heparin in combination with tPA improved outcomes compared to tPA alone.\nSubsequent trials have confirmed and expanded upon these findings. For example, the ECASS III trial, published in 2008, found that low-molecular-weight heparin improved functional outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke who were also receiving tPA. The PRoFESS trial, published in 2009, found that extended-duration anticoagulation with warfarin improved outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke who had a high risk of stroke recurrence.\nIt is important to note that while anticoagulants have been shown to be effective in improving outcomes after acute ischemic stroke, they are not without risk. Anticoagulants can increase the risk of bleeding, which can be dangerous in some cases. Therefore, it is important for patients and healthcare providers to carefully weigh the benefits and risks of anticoagulation therapy in each individual case.\nIn summary, there is robust evidence from randomized controlled trials to support the use of anticoagulants in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. However, the decision to initiate antico",

            "gold_answer": "Four types of rotavirus vaccines were evaluated for preventing rotavirus diarrhea: Rotarix, RotaTeq, Rotasiil, and Rotavac. All four vaccines have been shown to reduce severe rotavirus diarrhea in evaluations of up to two years, and three vaccines (Rotarix, RotaTeq, and Rotavac) have been shown to reduce severe all\u2010cause diarrhea. The impact of these vaccines on other outcomes, including all\u2010cause mortality and serious adverse events such as intussusception, is less clear. Rotarix, given in 2 doses at 4\u2010 to 10\u2010week interval Moderate\u2010 to high\u2010certainty evidence shows that compared with control (placebo or no intervention), fewer infants who received Rotarix developed severe rotavirus diarrhea (2 vs 9 per 1000 infants, all results on average) and severe all\u2010cause diarrhea (25 vs 39 per 1000 infants) at one\u2010year follow\u2010up. All\u2010cause mortality was similar between groups (low\u2010certainty evidence for low\u2010mortality countries, and moderate\u2010certainty evidence for other countries). Fewer infants who received Rotarix developed serious adverse events (29 vs 33 per 1000 infants) (high\u2010certainty evidence), although there was no clear difference between groups in intussusception (low\u2010certainty evidence). RotaTeq, given in 3 doses at 4\u2010 to 10\u2010week interval High\u2010certainty evidence, especially from high\u2010mortality countries, shows that compared with placebo, fewer infants who received RotaTeq developed severe rotavirus diarrhea (4 vs 23 per 1000 infants at 1\u2010year follow\u2010up) and severe all\u2010cause diarrhea (119 vs 139 per 1000 infants at 2\u2010year follow\u2010up). There was little to no difference between groups in all\u2010cause mortality, serious adverse events, and intussusception (moderate\u2010certainty evidence for high\u2010mortality countries, and low\u2010 to very low\u2010certainty evidence for other countries). Rotasiil, given in 3 doses at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age or with at least 4\u2010week interval between doses High\u2010certainty evidence from high\u2010mortality countries shows that compared with placebo, fewer infants who received Rotasiil developed severe rotavirus diarrhea (19 vs 37 per 1000 infants at 1\u2010year follow\u2010up), with consistent findings at 2\u2010year follow\u2010up. There was little to no difference between groups in severe all\u2010cause diarrhea (high\u2010certainty evidence), all\u2010cause mortality (moderate\u2010certainty evidence), serious adverse events (high\u2010certainty evidence), and intussusception (low\u2010certainty evidence). Rotavac, given in a single dose at 8 weeks of age, or 3 doses given at 4\u2010 to 8\u2010week interval Moderate\u2010certainty evidence for high\u2010mortality countries shows that compared with placebo, fewer infants who received Rotavac developed severe rotavirus diarrhea (13 vs 31 per 1000 infants) and severe all\u2010cause diarrhea (78 vs 93 per 1000 infants) at one\u2010year follow\u2010up. There was no clear difference between groups in all\u2010cause mortality (very low\u2010certainty evidence), serious adverse events (moderate\u2010certainty evidence), and intussusception (very low\u2010certainty evidence).",

            "gold_answer": "Four types of rotavirus vaccines were evaluated for preventing rotavirus diarrhea: Rotarix, RotaTeq, Rotasiil, and Rotavac. All four vaccines have been shown to reduce severe rotavirus diarrhea in evaluations of up to two years, and three vaccines (Rotarix, RotaTeq, and Rotavac) have been shown to reduce severe all\u2010cause diarrhea. The impact of these vaccines on other outcomes, including all\u2010cause mortality and serious adverse events such as intussusception, is less clear. Rotarix, given in 2 doses at 4\u2010 to 10\u2010week interval Moderate\u2010 to high\u2010certainty evidence shows that compared with control (placebo or no intervention), fewer infants who received Rotarix developed severe rotavirus diarrhea (2 vs 9 per 1000 infants, all results on average) and severe all\u2010cause diarrhea (25 vs 39 per 1000 infants) at one\u2010year follow\u2010up. All\u2010cause mortality was similar between groups (low\u2010certainty evidence for low\u2010mortality countries, and moderate\u2010certainty evidence for other countries). Fewer infants who received Rotarix developed serious adverse events (29 vs 33 per 1000 infants) (high\u2010certainty evidence), although there was no clear difference between groups in intussusception (low\u2010certainty evidence). RotaTeq, given in 3 doses at 4\u2010 to 10\u2010week interval High\u2010certainty evidence, especially from high\u2010mortality countries, shows that compared with placebo, fewer infants who received RotaTeq developed severe rotavirus diarrhea (4 vs 23 per 1000 infants at 1\u2010year follow\u2010up) and severe all\u2010cause diarrhea (119 vs 139 per 1000 infants at 2\u2010year follow\u2010up). There was little to no difference between groups in all\u2010cause mortality, serious adverse events, and intussusception (moderate\u2010certainty evidence for high\u2010mortality countries, and low\u2010 to very low\u2010certainty evidence for other countries). Rotasiil, given in 3 doses at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age or with at least 4\u2010week interval between doses High\u2010certainty evidence from high\u2010mortality countries shows that compared with placebo, fewer infants who received Rotasiil developed severe rotavirus diarrhea (19 vs 37 per 1000 infants at 1\u2010year follow\u2010up), with consistent findings at 2\u2010year follow\u2010up. There was little to no difference between groups in severe all\u2010cause diarrhea (high\u2010certainty evidence), all\u2010cause mortality (moderate\u2010certainty evidence), serious adverse events (high\u2010certainty evidence), and intussusception (low\u2010certainty evidence). Rotavac, given in a single dose at 8 weeks of age, or 3 doses given at 4\u2010 to 8\u2010week interval Moderate\u2010certainty evidence for high\u2010mortality countries shows that compared with placebo, fewer infants who received Rotavac developed severe rotavirus diarrhea (13 vs 31 per 1000 infants) and severe all\u2010cause diarrhea (78 vs 93 per 1000 infants) at one\u2010year follow\u2010up. There was no clear difference between groups in all\u2010cause mortality (very low\u2010certainty evidence), serious adverse events (moderate\u2010certainty evidence), and intussusception (very low\u2010certainty evidence).",

            "llm_answer": "Rotavirus vaccines have been shown to be highly effective in preventing rotavirus diarrhea in infants and young children. The benefits of vaccination include:\n* Protection against rotavirus diarrhea: Rotavirus vaccines have been shown to reduce the risk of rotavirus diarrhea by 70-90% in vaccinated children.\n* Reduced risk of dehydration and hospitalization: Rotavirus diarrhea can lead to severe dehydration and hospitalization, especially in young children. Vaccination can reduce the risk of these complications.\n* Reduced risk of death: Rotavirus diarrhea can be fatal, especially in developing countries. Vaccination has been shown to reduce the risk of death from rotavirus diarrhea.\nDespite the benefits, there are some potential harms associated with rotavirus vaccines. These include:\n* Mild side effects: Like any vaccine, rotavirus vaccines can cause mild side effects such as fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. These side effects are generally mild and temporary.\n* Rare but serious side effects: There is a small risk of more serious side effects from rotavirus vaccines, such as intussusception (a blockage of the intestine) or Kawasaki disease (a rare autoimmune disease). However, these risks are very low and much less common than the risks associated with rotavirus diarrhea.\nIt's important to note that the benefits of rotavirus vaccination far outweigh the risks, and the vaccines have been shown to be safe and effective in numerous clinical trials. It's important to follow the recommended vaccination schedule to ensure maximum protection against rotavirus diarrhea.",

            "gold_answer": "HPV vaccines, in women aged 15 to 26 years, can result in lower risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) \u2265 grade 2 (CIN2+), CIN3, and adenocarcinoma\u2010in\u2010situ (AIS). These benefits are higher for lesions irrespective of baseline HPV type status than for lesions associated with HPV16/18. Local adverse events are more common with HPV vaccines, but overall systemic events and serious events are not increased. Information on cervical cancer is not available. High\u2010certainty evidence shows that fewer women had CIN2+ associated with HPV16/18 with the HPV vaccine than with placebo regardless of baseline HPV status with at least one dose (with differences of 162 per 10,000 high\u2010risk\u2010HPV (hr\u2010HPV) negative women, 107 per 10,000 HPV16/18 DNA negative women, and 184 per 10,000 women with mixed HPV DNA status; all results on average). Risk of CIN3+ was also lower in vaccinated women regardless of baseline HPV status (with differences of 70 per 10,000 hr\u2010HPV negative women and 74 per 10,000 women with mixed HPV DNA status). Based on moderate\u2010 to high\u2010certainty evidence, fewer women had AIS associated with HPV16/18 with the at least one dose of HPV vaccine than with placebo regardless of baseline HPV status (with a difference of 9 per 10,000 hr\u2010HPV negative women and 11 per 10,000 women with mixed HPV DNA status). High\u2010certainty evidence shows that fewer women had any CIN2+ with at least one dose of the HPV vaccine than with placebo irrespective of baseline HPV status (with differences of 181 per 10,000 hr\u2010HPV negative women, 136 per 10,000 HPV16/18 DNA negative women, and 168 per 10,000 women with mixed HPV DNA status). Results also favored the HPV vaccine for any CIN3+ irrespective of baseline HPV status, although the certainty of the evidence was moderate (with a difference of 86 per 10,000 hr\u2010HPV negative women and 88 per 10,000 women with mixed HPV DNA status). Based on moderate\u2010 to high\u2010certainty evidence, fewer women had AIS irrespective of baseline HPV status with at least one dose of HPV vaccine than with placebo (with a difference of 10 per 10,000 hr\u2010HPV negative women and 12 per 10,000 women with mixed HPV DNA status). Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that likely more women experienced injection site adverse events (such as pain, swelling, and redness) with the HPV vaccine than with placebo (810 vs 717 per 1000 women), but there was little to no difference between groups in overall systemic events and general symptoms. High\u2010certainty evidence shows similar rates of adverse events in both groups, and low\u2010certainty evidence suggests there is no clear difference in mortality. Cervical cancer was not assessed.",

            "gold_answer": "HPV vaccines, in women aged 15 to 26 years, can result in lower risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) \u2265 grade 2 (CIN2+), CIN3, and adenocarcinoma\u2010in\u2010situ (AIS). These benefits are higher for lesions irrespective of baseline HPV type status than for lesions associated with HPV16/18. Local adverse events are more common with HPV vaccines, but overall systemic events and serious events are not increased. Information on cervical cancer is not available. High\u2010certainty evidence shows that fewer women had CIN2+ associated with HPV16/18 with the HPV vaccine than with placebo regardless of baseline HPV status with at least one dose (with differences of 162 per 10,000 high\u2010risk\u2010HPV (hr\u2010HPV) negative women, 107 per 10,000 HPV16/18 DNA negative women, and 184 per 10,000 women with mixed HPV DNA status; all results on average). Risk of CIN3+ was also lower in vaccinated women regardless of baseline HPV status (with differences of 70 per 10,000 hr\u2010HPV negative women and 74 per 10,000 women with mixed HPV DNA status). Based on moderate\u2010 to high\u2010certainty evidence, fewer women had AIS associated with HPV16/18 with the at least one dose of HPV vaccine than with placebo regardless of baseline HPV status (with a difference of 9 per 10,000 hr\u2010HPV negative women and 11 per 10,000 women with mixed HPV DNA status). High\u2010certainty evidence shows that fewer women had any CIN2+ with at least one dose of the HPV vaccine than with placebo irrespective of baseline HPV status (with differences of 181 per 10,000 hr\u2010HPV negative women, 136 per 10,000 HPV16/18 DNA negative women, and 168 per 10,000 women with mixed HPV DNA status). Results also favored the HPV vaccine for any CIN3+ irrespective of baseline HPV status, although the certainty of the evidence was moderate (with a difference of 86 per 10,000 hr\u2010HPV negative women and 88 per 10,000 women with mixed HPV DNA status). Based on moderate\u2010 to high\u2010certainty evidence, fewer women had AIS irrespective of baseline HPV status with at least one dose of HPV vaccine than with placebo (with a difference of 10 per 10,000 hr\u2010HPV negative women and 12 per 10,000 women with mixed HPV DNA status). Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that likely more women experienced injection site adverse events (such as pain, swelling, and redness) with the HPV vaccine than with placebo (810 vs 717 per 1000 women), but there was little to no difference between groups in overall systemic events and general symptoms. High\u2010certainty evidence shows similar rates of adverse events in both groups, and low\u2010certainty evidence suggests there is no clear difference in mortality.

The vaccine is typically recommended for preteen girls and boys aged 11-12 years old, but it can also be given to older individuals who have not yet been vaccinated or have not completed the full vaccination series.\nFor 15- to 26-year-old women, the advantages of getting the HPV vaccine include:\nAdvantages:\n* Protection against certain types of cancer, such as cervical, vulvar, vaginal, and anal cancers\n* Protection against genital warts\n* Reduced risk of developing precancerous lesions\n* Reduced risk of abnormal Pap test results\n* Reduced risk of HPV-related diseases in sexual partners\n* Can help prevent HPV transmission\nIt's important to note that the HPV vaccine is not a replacement for regular Pap tests, which are still necessary for the early detection of cervical cancer.\nAs for the disadvantages, there are few risks associated with the HPV vaccine. The most common side effects are mild and temporary, such as pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site, fatigue, and headache.\nDisadvantages:\n* Mild and temporary side effects, such as pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site, fatigue, and headache\n* The vaccine is not 100% effective, so it's still possible to contract HPV even after being vaccinated\n* The vaccine is not a replacement for regular Pap tests, which are still necessary for the early detection of cervical cancer\n* The vaccine is not recommended for pregnant women or people with weakened immune systems\nIt's important to note that the benefits of the HPV vaccine far outweigh the risks, and it's generally considered safe and effective in preventing HPV-related diseases.

They found out that sensitivity and specificity for any chest X\u2010ray (CXR) abnormality (95% and 89%) were higher than for cough \u2265 two weeks (42% and 94%) and cough of any duration (51% and 88%). The pooled sensitivity and specificity of cough for two weeks or more in the diagnosis of active pulmonary TB (by culture, sputum smear microscopy, or Xpert MTB/RIF/other nucleic acid amplification test) were 42% and 94%, respectively (41 studies). This means that at a prevalence of 0.5%, 1%, and 2%, for every 1000 people screened, 56, 55, and 56 people would be misdiagnosed as pulmonary TB; and 3, 6, and 12 diagnoses would be missed, respectively. The evidence was of very low certainty for true positives/false negatives and high certainty for true negatives/false positives. The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 51% and 88%, respectively (21 studies) for cough of any duration and 71% and 65%, respectively (29 studies) for any TB symptom. Hence, at a prevalence of 0.5%, 1%, and 2%, for every 1000 people screened for cough of any duration, 124, 123, and 122 people would be misdiagnosed as pulmonary TB, and 2, 5, and 10 diagnoses would be missed, respectively. For every 1000 people screened for any TB symptom, 347, 346, and 342 people would be misdiagnosed, and 1, 3, and 6 diagnoses would be missed, respectively. The pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity were 95% and 89%, respectively (23 studies) for any CXR abnormality for diagnosing confirmed pulmonary TB and 85% and 96%, respectively (19 studies) for CXR abnormalities suggestive of TB. The certainty of evidence regarding any CXR abnormality was very low for true positives/false negatives and low for true negatives/false positives, and regarding CXR abnormalities suggestive of TB was low and high, respectively. At three levels of prevalence (0.5%, 1%, and 2%) for every 1000 people screened, any CXR abnormality might wrongly diagnose 108, 108, and 107 people; and 0, 1, and 1 people would be misdiagnosed, respectively.

However, the accuracy of chest radiography can be affected by various factors, such as the quality of the radiograph and the expertise of the interpreter.\nIt's important to note that both symptom screening and chest radiography have limited accuracy, and a definitive diagnosis of active pulmonary TB requires a positive result on a diagnostic test such as a sputum smear or nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT).

Evidence comes from two cluster RCTs performed in France, and in Mali and Senegal, respectively, supporting the use of these types of reviews even in high\u2010income countries. In January 2019, reviewers identified one cluster RCT conducted in France (95 maternity units, 165,353 births, published in 2017) providing moderate\u2010certainty evidence that perinatal death reviews probably reduce perinatal morbidity related to suboptimal care (76 vs 115 infants with morbidity related to suboptimal care per 1000 morbidity cases, whose quality of care could be scored; all results on average). Results for perinatal mortality were inconclusive. This RCT reported no other outcomes. Reviewers identified a second cluster RCT conducted in Mali and Senegal (46 hospitals, 197,336 women, published in 2013) providing moderate\u2010certainty evidence that maternal death reviews probably reduce inpatient maternal mortality (605 vs 711 per 100,000 women), reduce neonatal mortality within 24 hours (8 vs 11 deaths per 1000 live births), and increase the number of women who received high\u2010quality care (442 vs 298 per 1000 women).

Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that can help maintain a healthy gut microbiome, which is important for the development and function of various bodily systems, including the immune system.\nStudies have found that probiotics can help reduce the risk of preterm birth, which is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Probiotics have also been shown to reduce the risk of other complications in preterm infants, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious condition that can cause damage to the intestines.\nIt's important to note that not all probiotics are the same, and some strains have been found to be more effective than others in preventing morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. For example, the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any supplements during pregnancy, including probiotics, to ensure safety and effectiveness. Additionally, it's important to note that while probiotics can help reduce the risk of complications, they are not a guarantee against them, and other factors such as proper prenatal care, a healthy diet, and a safe delivery are also important for a healthy pregnancy and baby.",
