However, they have different mechanisms of action and may have different efficacy profiles in certain situations.\nArtesunate is a rapidly acting blood schizontocidal drug that is effective against all stages of the parasite's life cycle, including the gametocytes. It is often used in combination with a longer-acting drug, such as mefloquine or lumefantrine, to ensure that the parasite is fully cleared from the body.\nAtovaquone-proguanil, on the other hand, is a combination therapy that works by inhibiting the parasite's mitochondrial electron transport chain, which is essential for its survival. It is also effective against gametocytes and has a longer half-life than artesunate, which allows for a shorter treatment course.\nStudies have shown that both artesunate-containing regimens and atovaquone-proguanil are effective in treating uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria, with cure rates of around 90% or higher. However, atovaquone-proguanil may have a slight advantage in terms of efficacy, particularly in areas where there is a high prevalence of drug-resistant parasites.\nIt's important to note that the choice of treatment depends on various factors, such as the severity of the infection, the patient's age, weight, and medical history, and the local prevalence of drug-resistant parasites. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional to determine the most appropriate treatment for each individual case.\nIn summary, both artesunate-containing regimens and atovaquone-proguanil are effective treatments for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria, but atovaquone-proguanil may have a slight advantage in terms of efficacy in areas with drug-resistant parasites. The choice of treatment should be made by a healthcare professional based on individual patient factors and",

Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests there is little to no difference in indoor adult mosquito density between groups. Fewer people used bed net with screening than with no screening (3 RCTs with 2508 participants). Results on clinical Plasmodium falciparum malaria incidence were very uncertain.",

Screening doors and windows can prevent mosquitoes from entering the home, while other modifications, such as sealing cracks and crevices, can help to reduce the number of mosquitoes that can enter the home. Additionally, house modifications can also reduce the attractiveness of the home to mosquitoes by reducing the amount of standing water around the home, which can reduce the number of mosquitoes that lay eggs in the area. Overall, house modifications can be a useful tool in preventing malaria, especially when used in combination with other mosquito control measures, such as insecticide-treated bed nets and indoor residual spraying.",

            "gold_answer": "Based on high\u2010 to moderate\u2010certainty evidence, screening to protect homes from mosquito entry (sometimes combined with insecticide and other house modifications) reduces the number of people with moderate to severe anemia (92 vs 211 per 1000 people; all results on average) and probably reduces malaria parasite prevalence at six months to two years (106 vs 115 per 1000 people) compared with no screening. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests there is little to no difference in indoor adult mosquito density between groups. Fewer people used bed net with screening than with no screening (3 RCTs with 2508 participants). Results on clinical Plasmodium falciparum malaria incidence were very uncertain.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "SCREENING (screening): A test or set of tests to check for a condition in a person who shows no symptoms, but who may be at risk (perhaps because of their age or sexual behaviour, for example).\nANEMIA (anemia): decreased red blood cells; low red cell blood count\nRCT (rct): A study which tests the effectiveness and safety of treatments or procedures as fairly and objectively as possible. By randomly assigning patients to different treatments for the same problem, the results can be assessed equally with the aim of discovering the best possible procedure for the condition.\nCLINICAL (clinical): pertaining to medical care",

            "llm_answer": "House modifications, including screening potential dwelling entry points, can be an effective way to prevent malaria. Screening doors and windows can help prevent mosquitoes from entering the home, which can reduce the risk of malaria transmission. Additionally, other house modifications such as installing insecticide-treated bed nets, sealing cracks and crevices, and eliminating standing water around the home can also help prevent malaria.\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), house modifications can reduce the risk of malaria by up to 90%. However, it is important to note that house modifications alone may not be enough to completely eliminate the risk of malaria, and should be used in combination with other prevention methods such as using insecticide-treated bed nets, wearing protective clothing, and using indoor residual spraying.\nIt is also important to note that the effectiveness of house modifications in preventing malaria can vary depending on the design and implementation of the modifications, as well as the local mosquito species and transmission patterns. Therefore, it is important to consult with local health authorities and experts to determine the most effective modifications for a specific area.",

Little to no difference between groups was reported for patient satisfaction of cosmetic appearance.

Foam sclerotherapy uses a foam solution that is injected into the affected vein, while liquid sclerotherapy uses a liquid solution.\n2. Foam sclerotherapy is better suited for larger veins, while liquid sclerotherapy is better for smaller veins.\n3. Foam sclerotherapy may be more effective in cases where the vein is tortuous or has a lot of branches.\n4. Liquid sclerotherapy may be better tolerated by patients who have a fear of foam or who have had previous negative experiences with foam sclerotherapy.\n5. Both treatments have similar success rates, with studies showing that they are both effective in closing off varicose veins and improving symptoms.\nIt's important to note that both treatments should only be performed by a qualified medical professional and that the choice between the two will depend on the individual patient and their specific needs.

The effects of prophylactic abdominal drainage in people undergoing pancreatic surgery are:\n1. Reduced risk of POPF: Prophylactic abdominal drainage has been shown to reduce the risk of POPF by 30-50%.\n2. Shorter hospital stay: Patients who receive prophylactic abdominal drainage tend to have a shorter hospital stay compared to those who do not receive it.\n3. Less postoperative pain: Prophylactic abdominal drainage can help reduce postoperative pain, which can improve patient comfort and satisfaction.\n4. Faster recovery: By reducing the risk of POPF and postoperative pain, prophylactic abdominal drainage can help patients recover faster and return to their normal activities sooner.\n5. Improved overall outcomes: Prophylactic abdominal drainage has been associated with improved overall outcomes in patients undergoing pancreatic surgery, including lower rates of complications, readmissions, and mortality.\nIt is important to note that while prophylactic abdominal drainage is generally safe, it is not without risks. The drain can cause discomfort, pain, and infection, and may require additional surgical intervention if complications arise. Therefore, it is important for patients to discuss the risks and benefits of prophylactic abdominal drainage with their surgeon and make an informed decision based on their individual circumstances.",

Improved cardiac function: SCT has been shown to improve left ventricular ejection fraction, reduce cardiac remodeling, and improve symptoms such as shortness of breath and fatigue.\n2. Reduced inflammation: SCT has anti-inflammatory properties, which may help reduce inflammation in the heart and prevent further damage.\n3. Enhanced angiogenesis: SCT may promote the growth of new blood vessels, which can improve blood flow to the heart and reduce the risk of cardiac events.\nHowever, SCT for dilated cardiomyopathy is still an experimental treatment, and there are potential harms to consider, including:\nHarms:\n1. Risk of tumor formation: There is a risk of tumor formation or uncontrolled growth of stem cells after SCT, which can lead to serious complications.\n2. Immune rejection: The use of allogenic stem cells (from a donor) carries a risk of immune rejection, which can lead to serious complications.\n3. Infection: SCT carries a risk of infection, particularly if the stem cells are not properly sterilized.\n4. Cost and accessibility: SCT is still a relatively expensive treatment, and accessibility can be limited for some patients.\n5. Lack of standardization: There is currently a lack of standardization in the use of SCT for dilated cardiomyopathy, which can make it difficult to compare results across studies and determine the optimal treatment approach.\nOverall, while SCT shows promise for the treatment of dilated cardiomyopathy, more research is needed to fully understand its benefits and harms, and to establish standardized treatment protocols.",

Here are some potential benefits and harms associated with SCT for adults with dilated cardiomyopathy:\nBenefits:\n1. Improved cardiac function: SCT has been shown to improve cardiac function, including increased left ventricular ejection fraction and reduced left ventricular end-systolic volume, in some studies.\n2. Reduced symptoms: SCT may help reduce symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and swelling in the legs, which are common in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.\n3. Improved quality of life: By improving cardiac function and reducing symptoms, SCT may improve the overall quality of life for patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.\n4. Potential for reversal of disease progression: Some studies suggest that SCT may help reverse the progression of dilated cardiomyopathy, potentially halting or even reversing the decline in cardiac function.\nHarms:\n1. Safety concerns: SCT is still a relatively new and experimental treatment for dilated cardiomyopathy, and there is a lack of long-term safety data. There is a risk of adverse events, such as infection, bleeding, and arrhythmias, associated with the procedure.\n2. Limited efficacy: While some studies have shown improvements in cardiac function and symptoms, the efficacy of SCT for dilated cardiomyopathy is still uncertain and may vary depending on the patient population, type of stem cells used, and other factors.\n3. Cost and accessibility: SCT is a costly procedure, and access to it may be limited for some patients due to geographic, financial, or other factors.\n4. Ethical considerations: There are ethical considerations surrounding the use of stem cells, including concerns about the potential for unproven or unethical practices, such as the use of untested or unproven stem cell products.\nIt's important to note that SCT is not a cure for",

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers found very limited data to conclude whether pioglitazone is superior or inferior to alternative glucose\u2010lowering interventions for people at risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus. When pioglitazone was compared to metformin, results on the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, fasting plasma glucose, and non\u2010serious adverse events were imprecise. Data comparing pioglitazone to acarbose and to repaglinide were underpowered. RCTs were conducted in China, limiting the generalizability of these results.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "RISK (risk): The chance that an activity or hazard will give rise to harm. Risk is generally given in terms of numerical odds (1 in 10) or percentages (10%).\nDIABETES (diabetes): A condition caused by high levels of glucose (a form of sugar) in the blood. The amount of glucose in your blood is controlled by a hormone called insulin. See also Diabatetes Type 1 and Type 2 below.\nRCT (rct): A study which tests the effectiveness and safety of treatments or procedures as fairly and objectively as possible. By randomly assigning patients to different treatments for the same problem, the results can be assessed equally with the aim of discovering the best possible procedure for the condition.",

            "llm_answer": "Pioglitazone, a thiazolidinedione medication, has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus in people at high risk. However, its effectiveness compared to alternative glucose-lowering interventions, such as metformin, lifestyle modifications, and other medications, varies depending on the population studied and the specific outcome measures used.\nIn general, pioglitazone has been shown to have a similar or slightly inferior effect on glycemic control compared to metformin, but it may have a more favorable effect on lipid profiles and blood pressure. Lifestyle modifications, such as diet and exercise, are generally considered the most effective intervention for preventing type 2 diabetes, but adherence to these interventions can be challenging. Other medications, such as sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, may also be effective in reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes, but their long-term safety and efficacy are less well established compared to pioglitazone and metformin.\nUltimately, the choice of intervention will depend on individual patient factors, such as the presence of comorbidities, medication side effects, and patient preferences. It is important to consider the benefits and risks of each intervention and to individualize treatment based on the patient's unique needs and circumstances.",

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers found very limited data to conclude whether pioglitazone is superior or inferior to alternative glucose\u2010lowering interventions for people at risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus. When pioglitazone was compared to metformin, results on the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, fasting plasma glucose, and non\u2010serious adverse events were imprecise. Data comparing pioglitazone to acarbose and to repaglinide were underpowered. RCTs were conducted in China, limiting the generalizability of these results.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "RISK (risk): The chance that an activity or hazard will give rise to harm. Risk is generally given in terms of numerical odds (1 in 10) or percentages (10%).\nDIABETES (diabetes): A condition caused by high levels of glucose (a form of sugar) in the blood. The amount of glucose in your blood is controlled by a hormone called insulin. See also Diabatetes Type 1 and Type 2 below.\nRCT (rct): A study which tests the effectiveness and safety of treatments or procedures as fairly and objectively as possible. By randomly assigning patients to different treatments for the same problem, the results can be assessed equally with the aim of discovering the best possible procedure for the condition.",

            "llm_answer": "Pioglitazone is a medication that is sometimes used to reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus in people who are at high risk of developing the condition. Compared to other glucose-lowering interventions, pioglitazone has been shown to have some benefits and drawbacks.\nBenefits:\n* Pioglitazone has been shown to reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 50-70% compared to placebo in clinical trials.\n* It has also been shown to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce inflammation, which can help to reduce the risk of complications associated with type 2 diabetes.\nDrawbacks:\n* Pioglitazone can cause weight gain, which may be a concern for some people.\n* It may also increase the risk of heart problems, such as heart attack and stroke, in some people.\n* It can also cause fluid retention, which can lead to swelling and other symptoms.\nAlternative glucose-lowering interventions that may be considered for people at risk of developing type 2 diabetes include:\n* Lifestyle changes, such as a healthy diet and regular exercise, which can help to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.\n* Metformin, a medication that is commonly used to treat type 2 diabetes and has been shown to reduce the risk of developing the condition in people at high risk.\n* Other medications, such as sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones, which can also help to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.\nIt's important to note that the choice of intervention will depend on individual factors, such as the person's medical history, current health status, and lifestyle. It's important to discuss the options with a healthcare provider to determine the best course of action.",

            "gold_answer": "In women trying to conceive by intrauterine insemination or sexual intercourse, it is uncertain whether any dose or route of progesterone administration improves live birth/ongoing pregnancy rate or reduces miscarriages . It is unclear if ongoing pregnancy rate is higher with vaginal progesterone when compared with intramuscular (IM) progesterone (252 vs 149 per 1000 women; all results on average), oral progesterone (213 vs 267 per 1000 women), or aqueous subcutaneous progesterone (119 vs 125 per 1000 women), as the evidence is of very low certainty. It is also unclear if miscarriage rate (per woman) is lower with vaginal progesterone when compared with IM progesterone (180 vs 105 per 1000 women) or oral progesterone (40 vs 27 per 1000 women), based on very low\u2010certainty evidence. Very low\u2010certainty evidence suggests significantly higher adverse effects with IM progesterone than with vaginal progesterone (167 vs 18 per 1000 women). Very low\u2010certainty evidence suggests no improvement in ongoing pregnancy rate with 300 mg vaginal progesterone compared with 600 mg vaginal progesterone (190 vs 120 per 1000 women). The trials evaluating aqueous subcutaneous versus vaginal progesterone, oral versus vaginal progesterone, and 300 mg versus 600 mg vaginal progesterone did not report adverse effects. No trials reported live birth, preterm delivery, or congenital anomaly as outcomes.

            "llm_answer": "Progesterone is a hormone that plays a crucial role in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, which begins after ovulation and lasts until the end of pregnancy. In women trying to conceive, progesterone supplementation is often used as luteal phase support to help prepare the uterus for a potential pregnancy.\nThere have been several studies examining the effects of different doses and routes of administration of progesterone as luteal phase support in women trying to conceive via intrauterine insemination (IUI) or sexual intercourse. Here are some key findings:\n1. Dose: Research suggests that a higher dose of progesterone may be more effective in improving pregnancy rates in women undergoing IUI. A 2019 meta-analysis published in the journal Fertility and Sterility found that a dose of 400-600 mg/day of progesterone was associated with higher pregnancy rates compared to lower doses (200-300 mg/day). However, it's important to note that the optimal dose of progesterone for luteal phase support has not been consistently established and may vary depending on individual patient factors.\n2. Route of administration: The route of progesterone administration may also impact its effectiveness. Some studies have suggested that vaginal administration of progesterone may be more effective than oral administration, as it allows for more direct absorption into the uterus. A 2018 study published in the Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics found that vaginal progesterone was associated with higher pregnancy rates compared to oral progesterone in women undergoing IUI.\n3. Timing: The timing of progesterone administration may also play a role in its effectiveness. Some studies have suggested that starting progesterone supplementation too early in the luteal phase may not be effective, while starting it too late may reduce its effectiveness. A 2020 study published in the journal Fertility and Sterility found that starting progesterone supplementation on the day of ovulation or later resulted in higher pregnancy rates",

            "gold_answer": "Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that for adults with non\u2010toxic multinodular goiter, a single injection of rhTSH 24 to 72 hours prior to radioiodine therapy probably substantially increases rates of hypothyroidism at one to three years' follow\u2010up when compared with saline (i.e. placebo) injection (262 vs 103 per 1000 people; all results on average). RhTSH\u2010aided radioiodine treatment probably decreases thyroid size around 12% more than radioiodine alone (moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that adverse events such as mild cervical discomfort or localized pain are similar with both rhTSH and saline pre\u2010treatment injections, occurring in about half of all people. Likewise, there appear to be no clear differences in health\u2010related quality of life with or without rhTSH pre\u2010treatment (very low\u2010certainty evidence). Mortality risk is unclear due to insufficient data (no deaths among 18 who received rhTSH\u2010aided radioiodine treatment vs one death among 10 who received radioiodine alone; very low\u2010certainty evidence).",

            "gold_answer": "Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that for adults with non\u2010toxic multinodular goiter, a single injection of rhTSH 24 to 72 hours prior to radioiodine therapy probably substantially increases rates of hypothyroidism at one to three years' follow\u2010up when compared with saline (i.e. placebo) injection (262 vs 103 per 1000 people; all results on average). RhTSH\u2010aided radioiodine treatment probably decreases thyroid size around 12% more than radioiodine alone (moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that adverse events such as mild cervical discomfort or localized pain are similar with both rhTSH and saline pre\u2010treatment injections, occurring in about half of all people. Likewise, there appear to be no clear differences in health\u2010related quality of life with or without rhTSH pre\u2010treatment (very low\u2010certainty evidence). Mortality risk is unclear due to insufficient data (no deaths among 18 who received rhTSH\u2010aided radioiodine treatment vs one death among 10 who received radioiodine alone; very low\u2010certainty evidence).",
            "gold_answer_terms": "PLACEBO (placebo): an inactive substance; a pill/liquid that contains no medicine\nLOCALIZED (localized): restricted to one area, limited to one area\nMORTALITY (mortality): death\nRISK (risk): The chance that an activity or hazard will give rise to harm.

            "gold_answer": "The clinical presentation of oral lichen planus can vary from patient to patient, and not all patients present with pain or discomfort. When pain is present, the intensity and the location of lesions require a search for a palliative solution among patients and clinicians. Given that this is an inflammatory condition with an autoimmune component, the selection of corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors\u2014medications used to reduce inflammation and to control immunity\u2014seems sensible, although all evidence is of low or very low certainty. Benefit appears more obvious with use of a topical corticosteroid than placebo, and greater benefit is noted when topical corticosteroids are compared with calcineurin inhibitors, as the higher rate of adverse effects with calcineurin inhibitors must be considered. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that use of topical corticosteroid (clobetasol propionate 0.025% in 4% hydroxyethyl cellulose gel, once daily; flucinonide 0.025% in 40% hypromellose ointment in white soft paraffin, at least 6 times daily; or triamcinolone acetonide ointment 0.1%, 3 times daily) for a duration of eight to nine weeks may be more likely to resolve pain episodes than use of placebo (584 vs 306 per 1000 people had pain resolution; all results on average). For clinical resolution, very low\u2010certainty evidence favors the use of corticosteroids over placebo, although differences between groups were not statistically significant (300 vs 50 per 1000 people). Rates of adverse effects were similar in both groups and included gastroesophageal reflux, skin reactions, and oral sensitivity. When topical corticosteroids were compared with topical calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporine or tacrolimus), clobetasol seemed less effective than tacrolimus for pain resolution (198 vs 440 per 1000 people) after three to eight weeks of therapy (very low\u2010certainty evidence). However, clobetasol appears better than cyclosporine for increasing the rate of clinical resolution (474 vs 150 per 1000 people). Tacrolimus was no better than triamcinolone for this outcome. More people had adverse effects with calcineurin inhibitors than with corticosteroids (9 per 1000 people with clobetasol vs 180 per 1000 with tacrolimus; 243 per 1000 people with triamcinolone vs 516 per 1000 with tacrolimus). Adverse events included transient burning or stinging associated with application, dyspepsia, skin rash, localized swelling, and gastrointestinal upset.",

            "llm_answer": "Corticosteroids, placebo, and calcineurin inhibitors are all treatment options for oral lichen planus (OLP), a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the mouth. While there are limited studies comparing these treatments directly, here's a summary of the available information:\n1. Corticosteroids: Corticosteroids, such as prednisone, are commonly used to treat OLP due to their anti-inflammatory properties. They can help reduce symptoms like pain, erythema, and ulceration. However, their efficacy varies, and they may have side effects, especially with long-term use. A systematic review of 17 studies found that corticosteroids were effective in 71% of patients with OLP, but the quality of evidence was generally low.\n2. Placebo: Placebo treatments, such as sugar pills or saline injections, are often used in clinical trials to assess the body's natural healing process. In the context of OLP, placebo treatments have been shown to have a response rate of around 20-30%. While placebos can provide some relief, they are not a reliable long-term solution and may not be effective for more severe cases of OLP.\n3. Calcineurin inhibitors: Calcineurin inhibitors, such as pimecrolimus or tacrolimus, are a class of drugs commonly used to treat skin conditions like atopic dermatitis. They have also been used off-label to treat OLP, as they can reduce inflammation and promote wound healing. A few studies have shown that calcineurin inhibitors can be effective in treating OLP, with response rates ranging from 40% to 70%. However, these studies have been small and had limited follow-up periods.\nIn summary, corticosteroids are the most commonly used treatment for OLP, but their efficacy varies, and they may have side effects. Calcineurin inhibitors show promise, but more research is needed to establish their long-term safety and efficacy. Placebo treatments can provide some relief but are not a reliable long-term solution. It'",

Moderate\u2010quality evidence showed that this benefit was not sustained in the longer\u2010term (5 years). Low\u2010quality evidence suggests there was no benefit of an adjunctive corticosteroid in terms of reducing rates of disabling neurological deficit, ether within 24 months or at 5 years. There was no apparent impact of adjunctive corticosteroids on the incidences of hepatitis, hyperglycemia/glycosuria, gastrointestinal bleeding, or invasive bacterial infection but event rates were very low meaning conclusions cannot be drawn.",

Studies have consistently demonstrated that corticosteroids reduce the risk of death and disability in patients with tuberculous meningitis, particularly in those with severe disease. The use of corticosteroids has been associated with a significant reduction in mortality rates, from approximately 30-40% in untreated patients to around 10-20% in patients receiving corticosteroids. Additionally, corticosteroids have been shown to reduce the risk of long-term disability, such as hearing loss and cognitive impairment.

Moderate\u2010quality evidence showed that this benefit was not sustained in the longer\u2010term (5 years). Low\u2010quality evidence suggests there was no benefit of an adjunctive corticosteroid in terms of reducing rates of disabling neurological deficit, ether within 24 months or at 5 years. There was no apparent impact of adjunctive corticosteroids on the incidences of hepatitis, hyperglycemia/glycosuria, gastrointestinal bleeding, or invasive bacterial infection but event rates were very low meaning conclusions cannot be drawn.",

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers found no conclusive RCT evidence suggesting that administration of probiotics to pregnant women was superior or inferior to placebo in reducing morbidity or mortality in preterm infants. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that in pregnant women who received probiotics, the risk of preterm birth (< 37 weeks) and miscarriage/stillbirth was no more or less likely compared with those who did not receive probiotics. Only one RCT (159 infants) reported no incidences of early neonatal sepsis (\u2264 3 days) in either trial arm. For most outcomes, event rates were very low or there were no events in both arms. There is a lack of data on neonatal short\u2010term (early or late sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, neonatal death, hospital stay) and long\u2010term (major neurodevelopmental disability) potential benefits or harms following probiotic administration. None of the trials included women with a previous history of preterm birth, multiple pregnancy, or uterine anomaly. Reviewers did not assess serious adverse maternal or neonatal adverse events following use of probiotics.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "RCT (rct): A study which tests the effectiveness and safety of treatments or procedures as fairly and objectively as possible. By randomly assigning patients to different treatments for the same problem, the results can be assessed equally with the aim of discovering the best possible procedure for the condition.\nPLACEBO (placebo): an inactive substance; a pill/liquid that contains no medicine\nMORBIDITY (morbidity): undesired result or complication\nMORTALITY (mortality): death\nRISK (risk): The chance that an activity or hazard will give rise to harm. Risk is generally given in terms of numerical odds (1 in 10) or percentages (10%).\nSEPSIS (sepsis): The immune system's overreaction to an infection or injury which can lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and death.\nPOTENTIAL (potential): possible\nPOTENTIATE (potentiate): increase or multiply the effect of a drug or toxin (poison) by giving another drug or toxin at the same time (sometimes an unintentional result)\nPOTENTIATOR (potentiator): an agent that helps another agent work better\nASSESS (assess): to learn about, measure, evaluate, look at",

            "llm_answer": "Yes, probiotics administered to pregnant women have been shown to help prevent morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that can help maintain a healthy gut microbiome, which is important for the development and function of various bodily systems, including the immune system.\nStudies have found that probiotics can help reduce the risk of preterm birth, which is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Probiotics have also been shown to reduce the risk of other complications in preterm infants, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious condition that can cause damage to the intestines.\nIt's important to note that not all probiotics are the same, and some strains have been found to be more effective than others in preventing morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. For example, the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any supplements during pregnancy, including probiotics, to ensure safety and effectiveness. Additionally, it's important to note that while probiotics can help reduce the risk of complications, they are not a guarantee against them, and other factors such as proper prenatal care, a healthy diet, and a safe delivery are also important for a healthy pregnancy and baby.",
