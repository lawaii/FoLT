Atypical antipsychotics probably reduce agitation slightly, with a lower effect on psychosis. Both antipsychotic types increase the risk of somnolence, extrapyramidal symptoms, and any serious adverse events. For people with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia with agitation and psychosis, moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that, compared with placebo at 3 to 16 weeks, typical antipsychotics (haloperidol, thiothixene) probably result in more responders for agitation (814 vs 689 per 1000 people; all results on average). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests minimal to no difference in responders for psychosis and mortality, and a slight improvement on psychosis score. More people present with extrapyramidal symptoms (314 vs 139 per 1000 people; high\u2010certainty evidence) and somnolence (204 vs 78 per 1000 people; moderate\u2010certainty evidence), but there is minimal to no difference in any serious adverse events. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that, compared with placebo at 3 to 12 weeks, atypical antipsychotics (aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, pimavanserin, tiapride) probably result in more responders for agitation (400 vs 304 per 1000 people) and in minimal to small improvements on agitation and psychosis scores. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests more responders for psychosis (564 vs 500 per 1000 people). More people present with somnolence (82 vs 43 per 1000 people; high\u2010certainty evidence), extrapyramidal symptoms (75 vs 54 per 1000 people; moderate\u2010certainty evidence), and any serious adverse events (117 vs 88 per 1000 people), but there is probably minimal to no difference in mortality (moderate\u2010certainty evidence).",

However, research has shown that antipsychotics have limited effectiveness in managing these symptoms, and they can have significant side effects, particularly in older adults.\nOne study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that antipsychotics were associated with a small but statistically significant improvement in agitation and psychosis in people with Alzheimer's disease. However, the study also found that the medications were associated with a higher risk of stroke, sedation, and cognitive decline.\nAnother study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that antipsychotics were not effective in reducing agitation and psychosis in people with vascular dementia. The study also found that the medications were associated with a higher risk of falls, fractures, and stroke.\nIt's important to note that antipsychotics are not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis, and they are not recommended as a first-line treatment for agitation and psychosis in people with Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia.\nThe American Geriatrics Society recommends that clinicians use non-pharmacological interventions, such as behavioral therapy and environmental modifications, as the first line of treatment for agitation and psychosis in people with dementia. If medication is necessary, clinicians should consider using newer antipsychotics that have a lower risk of side effects, such as aripiprazole or quetiapine.\nIn summary, antipsychotics may have limited effectiveness in managing agitation and psychosis in people with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia, and they can have significant side effects. Non-pharmacological interventions and newer antipsychotics with a lower risk of side effects may be more effective and safer alternatives.

            "llm_answer": "Protons and photons are both used in radiation therapy for the treatment of chordoma, a rare type of cancer that affects the spine and skull base. However, they have different properties and advantages.\nProtons are charged particles that can be controlled to deposit their energy precisely at the tumor site, minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissue. They are particularly useful for treating chordomas that are located near critical structures such as the brain, spinal cord, or major blood vessels. Proton therapy can reduce the risk of damage to these structures and minimize side effects.\nPhotons, on the other hand, are uncharged particles that can travel through tissue and deposit their energy in a more random manner. They are better suited for treating larger tumors or tumors that are located in areas where there are less critical structures nearby. Photon therapy can be delivered using advanced techniques such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), which can help reduce the risk of damage to surrounding tissue.\nIn summary, protons are generally preferred for treating chordomas that are located near critical structures, while photons are better suited for treating larger tumors or tumors in less critical locations. The choice between protons and photons ultimately depends on the specific characteristics of the tumor and the individual patient's needs.",

            "llm_answer": "I must clarify that protons and photons are two different forms of radiation, and both have their unique properties and applications in cancer treatment. However, in the context of chordoma, a rare type of cancer that affects the spine and skull base, protons and photons have different roles and effectiveness.\nProtons are a type of particle radiation that can be precisely controlled to release their energy within a specific range, which makes them useful for treating tumors located near critical structures, such as the brain, spinal cord, or organs. Proton therapy can reduce the risk of damage to healthy tissues surrounding the tumor, especially in complex cases where the tumor is located near critical structures.\nPhotons, on the other hand, are a type of electromagnetic radiation that can also be used for cancer treatment. They have a longer range than protons and can penetrate deeper into the body, making them effective for treating tumors located in deeper tissues. However, photons can also cause more damage to healthy tissues surrounding the tumor, especially when they exit the body.\nIn the case of chordoma, protons are generally considered a better option than photons for several reasons:\n1. Chordomas are typically located near critical structures such as the brain, spinal cord, and major blood vessels. Protons can be precisely targeted to release their energy within a specific range, reducing the risk of damage to these critical structures.\n2. Chordomas are relatively radioresistant, meaning they are less responsive to radiation therapy compared to other types of cancer. Protons can deliver a higher dose of radiation to the tumor while minimizing damage to surrounding tissues, which can improve treatment outcomes.\n3. Protons can be used for both primary treatment and palliative care in chordoma patients. For patients with locally advanced or recurrent chordoma, proton therapy can be used to relieve symptoms such as pain, swelling, or difficulty swallowing.\nIn summary, while both protons and photons have their advantages and disadvantages, protons are generally considered a better option for treating chordoma due to their ability to precisely target the tumor while minimizing damage to surrounding critical structures.

Compared with a standard BP target (definition varied) for adults (mean age 57 to 71 years; 53% to 76% men) with hypertension and a history of cardiovascular disease, a lower BP target likely has no clear impact on mortality (moderate\u2010certainty evidence), but may lead to fewer people experiencing a cardiovascular event (97 vs 109 per 1000 people; low\u2010certainty evidence; all results on average) and a lower systolic and diastolic BP at the end of one year. People with the lower target may be taking slightly more antihypertensive medication at one to five years' follow\u2010up. However, fewer people seemed to achieve their BP target (62% vs 75%) and more withdrew from treatment owing to adverse effects (63 vs 8 per 1000 people; very low\u2010certainty evidence) with a lower BP target than with a standard BP target.",

Compared with a standard BP target (definition varied) for adults (mean age 57 to 71 years; 53% to 76% men) with hypertension and a history of cardiovascular disease, a lower BP target likely has no clear impact on mortality (moderate\u2010certainty evidence), but may lead to fewer people experiencing a cardiovascular event (97 vs 109 per 1000 people; low\u2010certainty evidence; all results on average) and a lower systolic and diastolic BP at the end of one year. People with the lower target may be taking slightly more antihypertensive medication at one to five years' follow\u2010up. However, fewer people seemed to achieve their BP target (62% vs 75%) and more withdrew from treatment owing to adverse effects (63 vs 8 per 1000 people; very low\u2010certainty evidence) with a lower BP target than with a standard BP target.",

Very low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that dental examinations at three\u2010month intervals and preventive treatments may lead to a lower incidence of MRONJ over approximately three years when compared with standard care (on average, 22 vs 233 per 1000 people). When reviewers compared a dental extraction protocol including plasma rich in growth factors (PRGF) with a standard dental extraction protocol that did not include PRGF, analyses were underpowered, and so no firm conclusions about prevention of MRONJ could be drawn. A similar result was reported for subperiosteal wound closure compared with epiperiosteal wound closure. Evidence for both comparisons was low to very low certainty.

Bisphosphonate holidays may reduce the risk of MRONJ in patients with cancer, but the optimal duration of the holiday is unclear. Dental extractions before cancer therapy may reduce the risk of MRONJ, but the evidence is limited. Antibiotic prophylaxis may reduce the risk of MRONJ in patients undergoing dental procedures, but the optimal antibiotic regimen is unclear.

            "gold_answer": "The effects of interventions for preventing medication\u2010related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) are unclear, as the available evidence is of low to very low certainty. Very low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that dental examinations at three\u2010month intervals and preventive treatments may lead to a lower incidence of MRONJ over approximately three years when compared with standard care (on average, 22 vs 233 per 1000 people). When reviewers compared a dental extraction protocol including plasma rich in growth factors (PRGF) with a standard dental extraction protocol that did not include PRGF, analyses were underpowered, and so no firm conclusions about prevention of MRONJ could be drawn. A similar result was reported for subperiosteal wound closure compared with epiperiosteal wound closure. Evidence for both comparisons was low to very low certainty. For the effects of different interventions for treating MRONJ, see CCA 4198",

However, some common interventions that have been shown to be effective in preventing or reducing the risk of MRONJ include:\n1. Dental evaluations and preventive dentistry: Regular dental evaluations and preventive dentistry measures, such as good oral hygiene, regular cleanings, and fluoride treatment, can help reduce the risk of MRONJ.\n2. Dose adjustments: Adjusting the dose of the medication, such as reducing the frequency or duration of use, can help reduce the risk of MRONJ.\n3. Alternative medications: In some cases, switching to a different medication that is less likely to cause MRONJ may be recommended.\n4. Bone health monitoring: Regular monitoring of bone health, such as with imaging tests, can help identify early signs of MRONJ and allow for prompt treatment.\n5. Mouthwashes and oral care products: Using mouthwashes and oral care products that contain ingredients that promote bone health and reduce inflammation may help reduce the risk of MRONJ.\n6. Vitamin and mineral supplements: Taking vitamin and mineral supplements, such as calcium and vitamin D, may help promote bone health and reduce the risk of MRONJ.\n7. Avoiding dental procedures: Avoiding dental procedures, such as tooth extractions, that can trigger MRONJ in patients taking medications that increase the risk of MRONJ.\nIt's important to note that the best approach will depend on the individual patient and their specific medical and dental history, as well as the medication they are taking. Patients should work closely with their healthcare provider and dentist to develop a personalized plan for preventing MRONJ.",

Blepharospasm is a condition characterized by involuntary spasms or contractions of the eyelid muscles, which can cause discomfort, eye redness, and vision problems.\nA systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials published in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry found that botulinum toxin type A was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing the severity of blepharospasm symptoms. The review included six studies that involved a total of 340 participants, and found that botulinum toxin type A was associated with a mean reduction in blepharospasm severity of 2.3 points on a 6-point scale, compared to 0.6 points with placebo.\nIt's important to note that while botulinum toxin type A is effective in reducing blepharospasm symptoms, it's not a cure for the condition. The effects of the treatment typically last for several months, and may need to be repeated to maintain symptom relief. Additionally, as with any medication, there are potential side effects associated with botulinum toxin type A, including droopy eyelids, double vision, and dry eyes. It's important to discuss the potential benefits and risks of this treatment with a qualified healthcare professional to determine if it's appropriate for your individual case.",

Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that physical activity probably leads to a small improvement in quality of life but probably has little to no effect on disease\u2010related depression or anxiety. Most outcomes were measured at three to six months, and the number of participants in the analyses was small. No trials reported overall survival or recurrence\u2010free survival.",

            "gold_answer": "For adults with non\u2010advanced colorectal cancer, low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that physical activity lasting one to six months may substantially improve physical fitness and may reduce cancer\u2010related fatigue (on average, by approx. 2 points on a 52\u2010point scale) but may have little to no effect on physical function or on adverse events that were generally minor. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that physical activity probably leads to a small improvement in quality of life but probably has little to no effect on disease\u2010related depression or anxiety. Most outcomes were measured at three to six months, and the number of participants in the analyses was small. No trials reported overall survival or recurrence\u2010free survival.",

            "gold_answer": "In people with stage I to III NSCLC treated with surgery or chemoradiotherapy with curative intent, high\u2010 to moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows no benefit of non\u2010checkpoint\u2010based immunotherapy (active or passive immunotherapy, tumor\u2010infiltrating lymphocytes and recombinant interleukin\u20102, natural killer cells or antigen\u2010specific cancer vaccines) over no treatment/supportive care/placebo in terms of overall or progression\u2010free survival. Moderate\u2010 to low\u2010certainty evidence suggests little to no difference in mortality when measured at specific time points (one, three, and five years). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests higher rates of any adverse events (820 vs 734 per 1000 people, on average) and severe adverse events (183 vs 161 per 1000 people, on average) with immunotherapy, although the results did not reach statistical significance.

            "gold_answer": "In people with stage I to III NSCLC treated with surgery or chemoradiotherapy with curative intent, high\u2010 to moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows no benefit of non\u2010checkpoint\u2010based immunotherapy (active or passive immunotherapy, tumor\u2010infiltrating lymphocytes and recombinant interleukin\u20102, natural killer cells or antigen\u2010specific cancer vaccines) over no treatment/supportive care/placebo in terms of overall or progression\u2010free survival. Moderate\u2010 to low\u2010certainty evidence suggests little to no difference in mortality when measured at specific time points (one, three, and five years). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests higher rates of any adverse events (820 vs 734 per 1000 people, on average) and severe adverse events (183 vs 161 per 1000 people, on average) with immunotherapy, although the results did not reach statistical significance. The reviewers decided not to include checkpoint inhibitors in their review, as only very limited evidence is available for this intervention.",

Other interventions, such as introducing mosquito predators or using larvicides, can also be effective in controlling mosquito populations.\nHowever, these interventions are not always successful, as they can be affected by factors such as the local ecology, water availability, and human behavior. For example, if there are still areas where water can collect and mosquitoes can breed, the intervention may not be effective. Additionally, some interventions can have unintended consequences, such as altering the local food chain or disrupting the natural balance of the ecosystem.\nIt's also important to note that while habitat modification and manipulation can help control malaria, it is not a standalone solution. It should be used in conjunction with other interventions, such as insecticide-treated bed nets, indoor residual spraying, and antimalarial drugs, to achieve the best results.\nIn summary, mosquito aquatic habitat modification and manipulation interventions can be effective in controlling malaria, but their effectiveness depends on the specific intervention, the local context, and the broader malaria control strategy.",

They work by reversing the constipating effects of opioids and promoting bowel movements.\nA systematic review and meta-analysis published in the Journal of Pain and Symptom Management found that methylnaltrexone and naldemedine were both effective in improving bowel function and reducing symptoms of OIBD in patients receiving palliative care. The study found that methylnaltrexone was more effective than naldemedine in reducing the risk of constipation, but naldemedine was more effective in reducing the risk of nausea and vomiting.\nIt's important to note that both medications can have side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. However, these side effects are generally mild and temporary.\nIt's also important to note that these medications should only be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional, as they may interact with other medications or have adverse effects in certain individuals.\nIn summary, methylnaltrexone and naldemedine are both effective treatments for opioid-induced bowel dysfunction in adults receiving palliative care.

Moderate\u2010quality evidence showed that this benefit was not sustained in the longer\u2010term (5 years). Low\u2010quality evidence suggests there was no benefit of an adjunctive corticosteroid in terms of reducing rates of disabling neurological deficit, ether within 24 months or at 5 years. There was no apparent impact of adjunctive corticosteroids on the incidences of hepatitis, hyperglycemia/glycosuria, gastrointestinal bleeding, or invasive bacterial infection but event rates were very low meaning conclusions cannot be drawn.",

Studies have consistently demonstrated that corticosteroids reduce the risk of death and disability in patients with tuberculous meningitis, particularly in those with severe disease. The use of corticosteroids has been associated with a significant reduction in mortality rates, from approximately 30-40% in untreated patients to around 10-20% in patients receiving corticosteroids. Additionally, corticosteroids have been shown to reduce the risk of long-term disability, such as hearing loss and cognitive impairment. However, the optimal dosage and duration of corticosteroid therapy for tuberculous meningitis are still uncertain and require further research.",

Moderate\u2010quality evidence showed that this benefit was not sustained in the longer\u2010term (5 years). Low\u2010quality evidence suggests there was no benefit of an adjunctive corticosteroid in terms of reducing rates of disabling neurological deficit, ether within 24 months or at 5 years. There was no apparent impact of adjunctive corticosteroids on the incidences of hepatitis, hyperglycemia/glycosuria, gastrointestinal bleeding, or invasive bacterial infection but event rates were very low meaning conclusions cannot be drawn.",

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers found no conclusive RCT evidence suggesting that administration of probiotics to pregnant women was superior or inferior to placebo in reducing morbidity or mortality in preterm infants. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that in pregnant women who received probiotics, the risk of preterm birth (< 37 weeks) and miscarriage/stillbirth was no more or less likely compared with those who did not receive probiotics. Only one RCT (159 infants) reported no incidences of early neonatal sepsis (\u2264 3 days) in either trial arm. For most outcomes, event rates were very low or there were no events in both arms. There is a lack of data on neonatal short\u2010term (early or late sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, neonatal death, hospital stay) and long\u2010term (major neurodevelopmental disability) potential benefits or harms following probiotic administration. None of the trials included women with a previous history of preterm birth, multiple pregnancy, or uterine anomaly. Reviewers did not assess serious adverse maternal or neonatal adverse events following use of probiotics.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "RCT (rct): A study which tests the effectiveness and safety of treatments or procedures as fairly and objectively as possible. By randomly assigning patients to different treatments for the same problem, the results can be assessed equally with the aim of discovering the best possible procedure for the condition.\nPLACEBO (placebo): an inactive substance; a pill/liquid that contains no medicine\nMORBIDITY (morbidity): undesired result or complication\nMORTALITY (mortality): death\nRISK (risk): The chance that an activity or hazard will give rise to harm. Risk is generally given in terms of numerical odds (1 in 10) or percentages (10%).\nSEPSIS (sepsis): The immune system's overreaction to an infection or injury which can lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and death.\nPOTENTIAL (potential): possible\nPOTENTIATE (potentiate): increase or multiply the effect of a drug or toxin (poison) by giving another drug or toxin at the same time (sometimes an unintentional result)\nPOTENTIATOR (potentiator): an agent that helps another agent work better\nASSESS (assess): to learn about, measure, evaluate, look at",

            "llm_answer": "Yes, probiotics administered to pregnant women have been shown to help prevent morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that can help maintain a healthy gut microbiome, which is important for the development and function of various bodily systems, including the immune system.\nStudies have found that probiotics can help reduce the risk of preterm birth, which is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Probiotics have also been shown to reduce the risk of other complications in preterm infants, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious condition that can cause damage to the intestines.\nIt's important to note that not all probiotics are the same, and some strains have been found to be more effective than others in preventing morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. For example, the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any supplements during pregnancy, including probiotics, to ensure safety and effectiveness. Additionally, it's important to note that while probiotics can help reduce the risk of complications, they are not a guarantee against them, and other factors such as proper prenatal care, a healthy diet, and a safe delivery are also important for a healthy pregnancy and baby.",
