More men (or their partners) also reported that they were able to have sexual intercourse with ginseng over placebo. Adverse effects were similar in both groups. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests greater improvement with ginseng compared with placebo in two areas of erectile function as measured by the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF): erectile function by up to 3.52 points on a 30\u2010point scale, and sexual satisfaction by 1.19 points on a scale from 1 to 15 at up to 12 weeks' follow\u2010up. Although these men had improved scores, these improvements do not reflect a clinically important difference between groups. The number of men reporting the ability to have intercourse (self\u2010 or partner\u2010reported rather than part of the validated questionnaire) was also higher with ginseng over placebo (on average, 661 vs 259 per 1000 men; low\u2010certainty evidence). None of the randomized trials included any assessment of quality of life.

            "gold_answer": "RCT evidence generally supports the effectiveness of acupuncture for treatment of chronic lower back pain in adults, although effects on specific immediate, short\u2010term, and intermediate\u2010term outcomes (up to about a year) are variable, depending on the particular outcome measure used. Acupuncture (manual or electro over multiple sessions) in addition to standard concomitant treatment (nonsteroidal anti\u2010inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], physical therapy modalities, educational information) may improve pain intensity (immediate to 12 months) by around 10 points on a scale from 1 to 100 at earlier time points and by around 4 points at 12 months, and may slightly improve global therapy effectiveness by 0.30 points on a scale from 1 to 6 points (immediate to 6 months) for adults with chronic lower back pain when compared with sham treatment (TENS or \u201dminimal\u201d needle placement) (moderate\u2010 to low\u2010certainty evidence). Back function and quality of life were variably improved with acupuncture (not immediately, but small benefit in the short to intermediate term), as was pain\u2010related disability (decreased immediately but not to the mid\u2010term range) (moderate\u2010 to very low\u2010certainty evidence). Little to no difference was reported for adverse event rates, with pain and hematoma/bleeding the most commonly reported events (low\u2010certainty evidence). When compared with no treatment/waitlist (6 to 12 weeks), acupuncture was more effective for reducing pain (immediate by around 20 points on a scale from 0 to 100, and short term by around 10 points on the same scale) and improving back function (immediate and short term), back disability (immediate term), and quality of life (immediate term) for adults with chronic low back pain (moderate\u2010 to low\u2010certainty evidence). Comparing acupuncture with usual care (physiotherapy and/or pain medication) yielded mixed results. Moderate\u2010 to very low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that acupuncture reduced pain (immediate by around 10 points on a scale from 0 to 100, and intermediate term by around 20 points on the same scale) and improved back function (at all time points) and global therapy effectiveness (short term and intermediate term). Back disability was reported to be better with acupuncture in the immediate term, but this effect was not sustained at later follow\u2010up. Quality of life scores were mixed depending on the measure used and the time point assessed, and little to no difference was reported for adverse events (low\u2010certainty evidence). Reviewers found no trials assessing mental health for any comparison.",

However, low\u2010certainty evidence suggests little to no difference in all\u2010cause mortality and serious adverse events between Novavax and placebo. Furthermore, high\u2010certainty evidence shows that compared with placebo, more people who received Novavax developed systemic reactogenicity and local reactogenicity events (76 and 341 more cases per 1000 people, respectively). Systemic and local reactogenicity events and serious adverse events were not reported for Soberana 2. Moreover, no trials assessed positive tests for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection following vaccination against COVID\u201019.",

However, low\u2010certainty evidence suggests little to no difference in all\u2010cause mortality and serious adverse events between Novavax and placebo. Furthermore, high\u2010certainty evidence shows that compared with placebo, more people who received Novavax developed systemic reactogenicity and local reactogenicity events (76 and 341 more cases per 1000 people, respectively). Systemic and local reactogenicity events and serious adverse events were not reported for Soberana 2. Moreover, no trials assessed positive tests for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection following vaccination against COVID\u201019.",

They have been developed as a potential tool for preventing COVID-19 and have shown promise in clinical trials.\nBenefits:\n1. High safety profile: Protein subunit vaccines have been shown to have a good safety profile, with minimal side effects observed in clinical trials.\n2. Effective against COVID-19: Protein subunit vaccines have been shown to be effective in preventing COVID-19 in clinical trials, with some vaccines demonstrating efficacy rates of up to 90%.\n3. Rapid production: Protein subunit vaccines can be produced rapidly, which is important in the context of a pandemic.\n4. Induction of both antibody and T-cell responses: Protein subunit vaccines can stimulate both antibody and T-cell responses, which provides broader protection against COVID-19.\n5. Potential for long-term protection: Protein subunit vaccines have the potential to provide long-term protection against COVID-19, although more research is needed to confirm this.\nRisks:\n1. Allergic reactions: As with any vaccine or medication, there is a risk of allergic reactions to protein subunit vaccines.\n2. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome: There is a small risk of developing Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS), a rare autoimmune disorder, after receiving a protein subunit vaccine. However, the risk is estimated to be less than 1 in 1 million.\n3. Myocarditis: There have been rare reports of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) following protein subunit vaccination.\n4. Pregnancy and fertility concerns: There is limited data on the use of protein subunit vaccines in pregnant women, and their impact on fertility is not well understood.\n5.

There may be an improvement in both short\u2010 and long\u2010term mental quality of life for those receiving psychological intervention, but this effect was not consistent for physical quality of life.

The results showed that patients with no residual disease after PDS had significantly better overall survival and progression-free survival compared to those with residual disease.\nAnother study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2018 also found that patients with complete residual disease removal after PDS had improved overall survival and progression-free survival compared to those with incomplete removal.\nIt is important to note that while residual disease after PDS is a significant predictor of survival, it is not the only factor that affects survival outcomes in patients with EOC. Other factors such as tumor stage, histology, grade, and response to chemotherapy also play a role.\nIn summary, residual disease after primary debulking surgery is a strong predictor of survival in women with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer.

Furthermore, results regarding changes in triglyceride and high\u2010density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels were very uncertain. There was little to no difference in systolic blood pressure between groups; however, only six RCTs with 629 participants contributed to this analysis.

Furthermore, results regarding changes in triglyceride and high\u2010density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels were very uncertain.

Evidence of low to moderate certainty suggests that NSAIDs may be more effective than opioids for reducing pain at seven days and increasing return to function while causing fewer gastrointestinal and neurological adverse events . For adult and pediatric patients with soft tissue injury, evidence shows little to no difference between treatment with NSAIDs and paracetamol or paracetamol plus opioid with regard to pain (at < 24 hours to seven or more days), swelling, return to function, or adverse events (gastrointestinal, neurological); time\u2010specific analyses were underpowered to detect a difference between groups. For adult and pediatric patients with soft tissue injury, the use of NSAIDs when compared with an opioid treatment led to greater improvement in pain seven or more days later (mean difference around \u20106.50 mm on a visual analogue scale [VAS] from 0 to 100 mm), more people experiencing return to function (on average, 763 vs 674 per 1000 people), and fewer gastrointestinal (150 vs 315 per 1000 people) and neurological (134 vs 336 per 1000 people) adverse events.

Additionally, NSAIDs are often available over-the-counter and have a good safety profile when used as directed. However, it's important to note that NSAIDs can have gastrointestinal side effects, such as stomach ulcers and bleeding, and long-term use can lead to renal problems.

            "gold_answer": "High\u2010certainty evidence shows equivalent effectiveness of non\u2010steroidal anti\u2010inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and paracetamol for improving pain in the immediate term in people with soft tissue injury; evidence for other outcomes is uncertain. Evidence of low to moderate certainty suggests that NSAIDs may be more effective than opioids for reducing pain at seven days and increasing return to function while causing fewer gastrointestinal and neurological adverse events . For adult and pediatric patients with soft tissue injury, evidence shows little to no difference between treatment with NSAIDs and paracetamol or paracetamol plus opioid with regard to pain (at < 24 hours to seven or more days), swelling, return to function, or adverse events (gastrointestinal, neurological); time\u2010specific analyses were underpowered to detect a difference between groups. For adult and pediatric patients with soft tissue injury, the use of NSAIDs when compared with an opioid treatment led to greater improvement in pain seven or more days later (mean difference around \u20106.50 mm on a visual analogue scale [VAS] from 0 to 100 mm), more people experiencing return to function (on average, 763 vs 674 per 1000 people), and fewer gastrointestinal (150 vs 315 per 1000 people) and neurological (134 vs 336 per 1000 people) adverse events. Reviewers found little to no difference between groups in swelling and pain at less than seven days, although time\u2010based subgroup analyses were underpowered.",

            "llm_answer": "Oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used to treat pain and inflammation associated with acute soft tissue injuries, such as sprains, strains, and contusions. Compared to other oral analgesic agents, NSAIDs have several advantages:\n1. Anti-inflammatory effects: NSAIDs not only relieve pain but also reduce inflammation, which can help reduce swelling and promote healing.\n2. GI tolerability: NSAIDs are generally well-tolerated by the gastrointestinal tract, with a lower risk of gastrointestinal ulcers and bleeding compared to other non-opioid analgesics like acetaminophen.\n3. Dosing flexibility: NSAIDs are available in a range of doses, allowing for titration to the individual patient's needs.\n4. Rapid onset of action: NSAIDs begin to take effect within 30 minutes to an hour after oral administration, providing quick relief for patients with acute pain.\n5. Combination therapy: NSAIDs can be combined with opioids or muscle relaxants when necessary, allowing for a more comprehensive approach to pain management.\n6. Cost-effectiveness: NSAIDs are generally less expensive than other oral analgesic agents, making them a cost-effective option for treating acute soft tissue injuries.\nHowever, it's important to note that NSAIDs may have some potential side effects, such as gastrointestinal upset, renal impairment, and allergic reactions. It's essential to follow the recommended dosage and consult with a healthcare professional if there are any concerns or pre-existing medical conditions.\nIn summary, oral NSAIDs are a popular choice for treating acute soft tissue injuries due to their anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, gastrointestinal tolerability, dosing flexibility, rapid onset of action, and cost-effectiveness. Always consult with a healthcare professional to determine the best course of treatment for a specific injury or condition.",

There are probably fewer early treatment failures with imiquimod than with MAL\u2010PDT (101 vs 158 per 1000 people); however, the confidence interval was also compatible with little to no effect. One study with 601 participants reported that some adverse effects were more common with imiquimod cream than with MAL\u2010PDT (moderate to severe local swelling, erosion, crust formation, itching, and influenza\u2010like symptoms), but moderate or severe local skin redness was seen with both interventions.",

Imiquimod cream is an immunomodulator that stimulates the immune system to fight cancer cells, while MAL-PDT uses a light-sensitive drug and a specific wavelength of light to kill cancer cells.\nIn terms of efficacy, MAL-PDT has been shown to have a higher complete response rate compared to imiquimod cream, with a response rate of around 90% compared to 70-80% for imiquimod. However, imiquimod cream may be better tolerated and has fewer side effects compared to MAL-PDT, which can cause pain, redness, and swelling.\nThe choice between imiquimod cream and MAL-PDT depends on various factors, including the location and size of the BCC, patient preference, and the experience and availability of the healthcare provider. MAL-PDT may be preferred for larger or more aggressive BCCs, while imiquimod cream may be a better option for smaller, more superficial BCCs.

            "gold_answer": "Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that probably fewer people have recurrence of BCC at three and five years and moderate/severe pain with imiquimod than with MAL\u2010PDT (288, 400, and 123 fewer per 1000 people, respectively; all results on average), with little to no difference between groups for cosmetic outcomes. There are probably fewer early treatment failures with imiquimod than with MAL\u2010PDT (101 vs 158 per 1000 people); however, the confidence interval was also compatible with little to no effect. One study with 601 participants reported that some adverse effects were more common with imiquimod cream than with MAL\u2010PDT (moderate to severe local swelling, erosion, crust formation, itching, and influenza\u2010like symptoms), but moderate or severe local skin redness was seen with both interventions.",

It is typically applied at home for several weeks to months, and can be effective for early-stage BCC.\nMAL-PDT, on the other hand, is a two-part treatment that involves applying a light-sensitive medication (methyl-aminolevulinate) to the skin, followed by exposure to a specific wavelength of light. This treatment is also effective for early-stage BCC and can be completed in a few sessions.\nA head-to-head comparison of imiquimod cream and MAL-PDT for BCC is challenging, as there are limited direct studies comparing the two treatments. However, some studies suggest that MAL-PDT may have a higher response rate and longer-lasting remissions compared to imiquimod cream, especially for more aggressive or larger tumors. However, imiquimod cream may be better tolerated and have fewer side effects compared to MAL-PDT, which can cause skin irritation and photosensitivity.\nUltimately, the choice between imiquimod cream and MAL-PDT will depend on various factors, including the size, location, and aggressiveness of the tumor, as well as the patient's individual preferences and medical history. A dermatologist or healthcare professional should be consulted to determine the most appropriate treatment for each patient.",

Moderate\u2010quality evidence showed that this benefit was not sustained in the longer\u2010term (5 years). Low\u2010quality evidence suggests there was no benefit of an adjunctive corticosteroid in terms of reducing rates of disabling neurological deficit, ether within 24 months or at 5 years.

Studies have consistently demonstrated that corticosteroids reduce the risk of death and disability in patients with tuberculous meningitis, particularly in those with severe disease. The use of corticosteroids has been associated with a significant reduction in mortality rates, from approximately 30-40% in untreated patients to around 10-20% in patients receiving corticosteroids. Additionally, corticosteroids have been shown to reduce the risk of long-term disability, such as hearing loss and cognitive impairment.

Moderate\u2010quality evidence showed that this benefit was not sustained in the longer\u2010term (5 years). Low\u2010quality evidence suggests there was no benefit of an adjunctive corticosteroid in terms of reducing rates of disabling neurological deficit, ether within 24 months or at 5 years. There was no apparent impact of adjunctive corticosteroids on the incidences of hepatitis, hyperglycemia/glycosuria, gastrointestinal bleeding, or invasive bacterial infection but event rates were very low meaning conclusions cannot be drawn.",

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers found no conclusive RCT evidence suggesting that administration of probiotics to pregnant women was superior or inferior to placebo in reducing morbidity or mortality in preterm infants. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that in pregnant women who received probiotics, the risk of preterm birth (< 37 weeks) and miscarriage/stillbirth was no more or less likely compared with those who did not receive probiotics. Only one RCT (159 infants) reported no incidences of early neonatal sepsis (\u2264 3 days) in either trial arm. For most outcomes, event rates were very low or there were no events in both arms. There is a lack of data on neonatal short\u2010term (early or late sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, neonatal death, hospital stay) and long\u2010term (major neurodevelopmental disability) potential benefits or harms following probiotic administration. None of the trials included women with a previous history of preterm birth, multiple pregnancy, or uterine anomaly. Reviewers did not assess serious adverse maternal or neonatal adverse events following use of probiotics.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "RCT (rct): A study which tests the effectiveness and safety of treatments or procedures as fairly and objectively as possible. By randomly assigning patients to different treatments for the same problem, the results can be assessed equally with the aim of discovering the best possible procedure for the condition.\nPLACEBO (placebo): an inactive substance; a pill/liquid that contains no medicine\nMORBIDITY (morbidity): undesired result or complication\nMORTALITY (mortality): death\nRISK (risk): The chance that an activity or hazard will give rise to harm. Risk is generally given in terms of numerical odds (1 in 10) or percentages (10%).\nSEPSIS (sepsis): The immune system's overreaction to an infection or injury which can lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and death.\nPOTENTIAL (potential): possible\nPOTENTIATE (potentiate): increase or multiply the effect of a drug or toxin (poison) by giving another drug or toxin at the same time (sometimes an unintentional result)\nPOTENTIATOR (potentiator): an agent that helps another agent work better\nASSESS (assess): to learn about, measure, evaluate, look at",

            "llm_answer": "Yes, probiotics administered to pregnant women have been shown to help prevent morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that can help maintain a healthy gut microbiome, which is important for the development and function of various bodily systems, including the immune system.\nStudies have found that probiotics can help reduce the risk of preterm birth, which is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Probiotics have also been shown to reduce the risk of other complications in preterm infants, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious condition that can cause damage to the intestines.\nIt's important to note that not all probiotics are the same, and some strains have been found to be more effective than others in preventing morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. For example, the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any supplements during pregnancy, including probiotics, to ensure safety and effectiveness. Additionally, it's important to note that while probiotics can help reduce the risk of complications, they are not a guarantee against them, and other factors such as proper prenatal care, a healthy diet, and a safe delivery are also important for a healthy pregnancy and baby.",
