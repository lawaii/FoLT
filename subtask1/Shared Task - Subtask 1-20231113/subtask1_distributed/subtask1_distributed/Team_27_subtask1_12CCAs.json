The effects of AF therapy for people with SAH include:\n1. Reduced risk of rebleeding: AF therapy can help prevent the breakdown of blood clots that can lead to rebleeding, which can worsen the condition and increase the risk of complications.\n2. Improved neurological outcomes: By preventing rebleeding, AF therapy can improve neurological outcomes and reduce the risk of long-term disability.\n3. Reduced risk of hydrocephalus: AF therapy can help reduce the risk of hydrocephalus, a complication in which excess cerebrospinal fluid accumulates in the brain, leading to increased intracranial pressure and potentially life-threatening complications.\n4. Shorter hospital stay: AF therapy can help patients recover faster and reduce the need for prolonged hospital stays.\n5. Reduced risk of vasospasm: AF therapy can help reduce the risk of vasospasm, a complication in which blood vessels in the brain constrict, leading to reduced blood flow and potentially life-threatening complications.\nIt is important to note that while AF therapy can be effective in treating SAH, it is not suitable for everyone and should only be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional. Additionally, it is important to note that AF therapy can have potential side effects and risks, such as an increased risk of infection, and patients should be closely monitored for signs of infection or other complications.",

Reduced risk of bacterial endocarditis: Prophylactic antibiotics have been shown to significantly reduce the risk of developing bacterial endocarditis in patients undergoing dental procedures.\n2. Prevention of infective endocarditis: Prophylactic antibiotics can prevent the development of infective endocarditis, a condition in which bacteria infect the inner lining of the heart or heart valves.\n3. Reduced risk of cardiac complications: Prophylactic antibiotics can reduce the risk of cardiac complications associated with bacterial endocarditis, such as heart failure, stroke, and arrhythmias.\n4. Improved patient outcomes: The use of prophylactic antibiotics in dentistry can improve patient outcomes by reducing the risk of serious complications associated with bacterial endocarditis.\n5. Cost-effective: Prophylactic antibiotics are a cost-effective measure for preventing bacterial endocarditis, as they are relatively inexpensive and can prevent the need for costly medical interventions.\n6. Reduced need for antibiotic treatment: Prophylactic antibiotics can reduce the need for antibiotic treatment in patients who develop bacterial endocarditis, as they can help prevent the infection from occurring in the first place.\n7. Improved patient comfort: Prophylactic antibiotics can improve patient comfort by reducing the risk of pain and discomfort associated with bacterial endocarditis.\n8. Reduced risk of antibiotic resistance: The use of prophylactic antibiotics in dentistry can reduce the risk of antibiotic resistance, as they are used in a targeted manner to prevent infection.\nOverall, the effects of prophylactic antibiotics for",

The effects of prophylactic antibiotics for the prevention of bacterial endocarditis in dentistry include:\n1. Reduced risk of bacterial endocarditis: Prophylactic antibiotics have been shown to significantly reduce the risk of developing bacterial endocarditis in patients undergoing dental procedures.\n2. Prevention of infective endocarditis: Prophylactic antibiotics can prevent the development of infective endocarditis, a condition in which bacteria infect the inner lining of the heart and cause inflammation.\n3. Reduced risk of heart valve damage: Prophylactic antibiotics can help prevent heart valve damage caused by bacterial endocarditis, which can lead to serious complications such as heart failure, stroke, and death.\n4. Reduced risk of septicemia: Prophylactic antibiotics can prevent the spread of bacteria from the mouth to the bloodstream, which can lead to septicemia, a potentially life-threatening condition.\n5. Reduced risk of prosthetic joint infection: Prophylactic antibiotics can also reduce the risk of prosthetic joint infection in patients with prosthetic joints.\nIt is important to note that prophylactic antibiotics should only be prescribed by a dentist or physician for patients who are at high risk of developing bacterial endocarditis, and should be used in conjunction with proper oral hygiene and dental care. Overuse or misuse of antibiotics can lead to antibiotic resistance, which can reduce their effectiveness in preventing infections.",

They work by blocking the activity of PARP, an enzyme involved in DNA repair, which is exploited by cancer cells to repair their damaged DNA, leading to resistance to chemotherapy. By inhibiting PARP, cancer cells are unable to repair DNA damage, leading to increased cell death and decreased tumor growth. Studies have shown that PARP inhibitors, such as olaparib, niraparib, and rucaparib, when used in combination with chemotherapy, result in a significant improvement in clinical outcomes for women with EOC, particularly for those with BRCA1/2 mutations. However, PARP inhibitors can also have side effects, such as nausea, fatigue, and anemia, and their use is generally limited to patients with BRCA1/2 mutations or those who have had a partial response to previous chemotherapy.",

            "llm_answer": "PARP inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy that have shown promise in the treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) in women. These drugs work by blocking the activity of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), an enzyme that plays a role in DNA repair and is overexpressed in many cancers. By inhibiting PARP, cancer cells are unable to repair DNA damage, leading to cell death.\nStudies have shown that PARP inhibitors can be effective in women with newly diagnosed EOC, particularly those with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. These mutations are associated with increased risk of EOC and are often found in women with familial breast and ovarian cancer syndrome.\nThe use of PARP inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy has been shown to improve progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in women with EOC. In particular, the addition of PARP inhibitors to chemotherapy has been shown to improve outcomes in patients with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations.\nCommon side effects of PARP inhibitors include nausea, fatigue, and anemia. However, these side effects are generally mild and can be managed with supportive care.\nIt is important to note that not all women with EOC will benefit from PARP inhibitors, and the use of these drugs should be carefully considered on a case-by-case basis. Patients with EOC should discuss their treatment options with their healthcare provider, including the potential benefits and risks of PARP inhibitors, to determine the best course of action for their individual situation.\nIn summary, PARP inhibitors can be an effective treatment option for women with newly diagnosed EOC, particularly those with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. When used in combination with chemotherapy, PARP inhibitors can improve progression-free survival and overall survival. However, it is important to carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of these drugs on a case-by-case basis.",

            "gold_answer": "Multifocal lenses may be superior to single vision lenses, and multifocal soft contact lenses may be superior to single vision soft contact lenses for slowing progression of myopia. Orthokeratology contact lenses probably slow elongation of the eyeball, but they are difficult to tolerate. For children (average age 10 years) with progressive low to high myopia (up to \u22128.75 diopters [D]), low\u2010certainty evidence suggests lower progression of myopia (lower change in spherical equivalent refraction (SER)) with multifocal lenses than with single vision lenses (by 0.14 D and 0.19 D at one and two years, respectively; all results on average). Axial length may also be lower with multifocal lenses (by \u22120.06 mm at one year and \u22120.07 mm at two years). Furthermore, multifocal soft contact lenses may be better than single vision soft contact lenses for slowing progression at two years (by 0.30 D) and reducing axial length at one year (by \u22120.11 mm) and two years (by \u22120.15 mm). Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that orthokeratology contact lenses probably result in lower axial length at one year (by \u22120.19 mm) and two years (by \u22120.28 mm) compared with single vision spectacle lenses. Results for other comparisons (undercorrection vs full correction, peripheral plus spectacles vs single vision spectacle lenses, or rigid gas\u2010permeable contact lenses vs single vision soft contact lenses) showed little to no difference between groups, or the certainty of evidence was very low. Reporting of adverse events was poor, but the most common adverse events with spectacle lens interventions were dizziness and blurred vision, and with contact lenses corneal infiltrative events, conjunctival papillary reactions, and corneal staining. There were high rates of withdrawal for children using orthokeratology contact lenses.",

Glasses and contact lenses are effective in correcting vision but do not slow myopia progression. OK, on the other hand, has been shown to slow myopia progression by 30-50% compared to glasses or contact lenses. Additionally, atropine therapy, which involves using eye drops to dilate the pupils, has been shown to slow myopia progression by 50-70% compared to placebo. However, the long-term effects of atropine therapy are not yet fully understood. It is important to note that these interventions may have varying effects on different children and should be discussed with an eye care professional.",

            "gold_answer": "Multifocal lenses may be superior to single vision lenses, and multifocal soft contact lenses may be superior to single vision soft contact lenses for slowing progression of myopia. Orthokeratology contact lenses probably slow elongation of the eyeball, but they are difficult to tolerate. For children (average age 10 years) with progressive low to high myopia (up to \u22128.75 diopters [D]), low\u2010certainty evidence suggests lower progression of myopia (lower change in spherical equivalent refraction (SER)) with multifocal lenses than with single vision lenses (by 0.14 D and 0.19 D at one and two years, respectively; all results on average). Axial length may also be lower with multifocal lenses (by \u22120.06 mm at one year and \u22120.07 mm at two years). Furthermore, multifocal soft contact lenses may be better than single vision soft contact lenses for slowing progression at two years (by 0.30 D) and reducing axial length at one year (by \u22120.11 mm) and two years (by \u22120.15 mm). Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that orthokeratology contact lenses probably result in lower axial length at one year (by \u22120.19 mm) and two years (by \u22120.28 mm) compared with single vision spectacle lenses. Results for other comparisons (undercorrection vs full correction, peripheral plus spectacles vs single vision spectacle lenses, or rigid gas\u2010permeable contact lenses vs single vision soft contact lenses) showed little to no difference between groups, or the certainty of evidence was very low. Reporting of adverse events was poor, but the most common adverse events with spectacle lens interventions were dizziness and blurred vision, and with contact lenses corneal infiltrative events, conjunctival papillary reactions, and corneal staining. There were high rates of withdrawal for children using orthokeratology contact lenses.",

            "llm_answer": "Optical interventions for myopia, also known as myopia control, are methods used to slow the progression of myopia in children. There are several types of optical interventions available, including:\n1. Glasses: Glasses are the most common form of myopia control. They work by correcting the refractive error caused by myopia, which helps to reduce the strain on the eyes and slow down the progression of the condition.\n2. Contact lenses: Contact lenses are another option for myopia control. They work in a similar way to glasses, but are worn directly on the eye instead of in front of it.\n3. Orthokeratology (Ortho-K): Ortho-K is a non-surgical procedure that uses a specialized contact lens to reshape the cornea while the patient sleeps. This reshaping process helps to correct the refractive error caused by myopia and can slow down its progression.\n4. Atropine therapy: Atropine therapy involves using eye drops to dilate the pupils, which can help to slow down the progression of myopia.\nStudies have shown that these optical interventions can be effective in slowing the progression of myopia in children. However, it's important to note that they may not completely stop the progression of myopia, and that the effectiveness of each intervention can vary depending on the individual child.\nIt's important to consult an eye doctor or an optometrist to determine the best course of treatment for a child with myopia. They will be able to assess the child's specific needs and recommend the most appropriate treatment option.",

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers performed network meta\u2010analyses comparing systemic treatments at the induction phase (evaluation at 8 to 24 weeks) for adults (aged 27 to 57 years) with moderate to severe psoriasis (Psoriasis Area Severity Index [PASI] score 10 to 39). Reviewers classified treatments as follows: non\u2010biological treatments (acitretin, methotrexate, fumaric acid esters, ciclosporin); anti\u2010interleukin (IL)\u201017 (secukinumab, brodalumab, ixekizumab, bimekizumab, sonelokimab, netakimab); anti\u2010IL\u201023 (guselkumab, tildrakizumab, risankizumab); anti\u2010IL\u201012/23 (ustekinumab); anti\u2010tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u2010alpha (etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab); and small molecules (apremilast, tyrosine kinase [TYK2] inhibitor). Infliximab, bimekizumab, ixekizumab, risankizumab, and secukinumab were rated as the five most effective treatments in terms of achieving PASI 90. The same five drugs, but in a slightly different order, were the most effective in achieving PASI 75 and Physician Global Assessment (PGA) score of 0 or 1. Regarding serious adverse events, the first five drugs achieving PASI 90 were rated 19th, 2nd, 12th, 3rd, and 18th, respectively, with people least likely to experience a serious adverse event with methotrexate, followed by bimekizumab, risankizumab, and certolizumab.",

            "llm_answer": "Systemic pharmacological treatments for chronic plaque psoriasis at the induction phase can be broadly classified into two categories: biologic and non-biologic treatments.\nBiologic treatments, such as adalimumab, etanercept, and ustekinumab, target specific proteins involved in the immune system and have been shown to be effective in achieving rapid and sustained improvement in psoriasis symptoms. They are generally more effective than non-biologic treatments, but are associated with a higher risk of adverse events and higher costs.\nNon-biologic treatments, such as methotrexate, cyclosporine, and acitretin, work by suppressing the immune system and are less effective than biologic treatments. However, they are generally better tolerated and less expensive.\nThe choice of treatment depends on the severity of psoriasis, patient preferences, and comorbidities. Biologic treatments are usually reserved for patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis who have not responded to non-biologic treatments or have significant functional impairment. Non-biologic treatments may be appropriate for patients with mild-to-moderate psoriasis or those who are unable to tolerate biologic treatments.\nIn summary, biologic treatments are more effective but associated with a higher risk of adverse events and costs, while non-biologic treatments are less effective but better tolerated and less expensive.

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers performed network meta\u2010analyses comparing systemic treatments at the induction phase (evaluation at 8 to 24 weeks) for adults (aged 27 to 57 years) with moderate to severe psoriasis (Psoriasis Area Severity Index [PASI] score 10 to 39). Reviewers classified treatments as follows: non\u2010biological treatments (acitretin, methotrexate, fumaric acid esters, ciclosporin); anti\u2010interleukin (IL)\u201017 (secukinumab, brodalumab, ixekizumab, bimekizumab, sonelokimab, netakimab); anti\u2010IL\u201023 (guselkumab, tildrakizumab, risankizumab); anti\u2010IL\u201012/23 (ustekinumab); anti\u2010tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u2010alpha (etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab); and small molecules (apremilast, tyrosine kinase [TYK2] inhibitor). Infliximab, bimekizumab, ixekizumab, risankizumab, and secukinumab were rated as the five most effective treatments in terms of achieving PASI 90. The same five drugs, but in a slightly different order, were the most effective in achieving PASI 75 and Physician Global Assessment (PGA) score of 0 or 1. Regarding serious adverse events, the first five drugs achieving PASI 90 were rated 19th, 2nd, 12th, 3rd, and 18th, respectively, with people least likely to experience a serious adverse event with methotrexate, followed by bimekizumab, risankizumab, and certolizumab.",

            "llm_answer": "Systemic pharmacological treatments for chronic plaque psoriasis at the induction phase can vary in terms of their efficacy, safety, and tolerability. Here's a brief comparison of some commonly used options:\n1. Methotrexate: Methotrexate is a widely used systemic treatment for psoriasis, known for its efficacy and relatively low cost. It can take several weeks to see the full effects, and it may cause side effects such as nausea, fatigue, and hair loss. Regular monitoring of blood cell counts and liver function is necessary.\n2. Cyclosporine: Cyclosporine is a potent immunosuppressant that can be effective for psoriasis, but it can have more side effects than methotrexate. It may cause gum hyperplasia, high blood pressure, and kidney damage. Regular monitoring of blood pressure, kidney function, and blood cell counts is necessary.\n3. Acitretin: Acitretin is a synthetic retinoid that can be effective for psoriasis, but it can have significant side effects, such as dry skin, fatigue, and gastrointestinal issues. It's important to avoid pregnancy and breastfeeding while taking this medication, as it can cause birth defects. Regular monitoring of liver function and blood lipids is necessary.\n4. Biologic medications: Biologics, such as adalimumab, etanercept, and ustekinumab, target specific proteins involved in the immune system and can be effective for psoriasis. They are generally well-tolerated, but they can be expensive and may increase the risk of infections. Regular monitoring of blood cell counts and liver function is necessary.\n5. JAK inhibitors: JAK inhibitors, such as tofacitinib, block the activity of enzymes called janus kinases, which are involved in the immune system. They can be effective for psoriasis, but they may increase the risk of infections and malignancies. Regular monitoring of blood cell counts and liver function is necessary.\nIt's important to note that the choice of treatment depends on",

Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that at > 6 to 15 months, quality of life probably improved (by 3.89 points, but did not reach the minimally clinically important difference of \u20104 points on St George's Respiratory Questionnaire), functional exercise capacity increased (by around 45 meters), hospital admissions were fewer (437 vs 510 per 1000 people), days spent in hospital per patient were fewer (around 2 days), and fewer people had ED visits (454 vs 548 per 1000 people) with IDM than with usual care. The number of patients experiencing \u2265 1 exacerbation, mortality, or need for oral steroids and antibiotics did not seem to be impacted by IDM, but some analyses were underpowered.",

Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that at > 6 to 15 months, quality of life probably improved (by 3.89 points, but did not reach the minimally clinically important difference of \u20104 points on St George's Respiratory Questionnaire), functional exercise capacity increased (by around 45 meters), hospital admissions were fewer (437 vs 510 per 1000 people), days spent in hospital per patient were fewer (around 2 days), and fewer people had ED visits (454 vs 548 per 1000 people) with IDM than with usual care. The number of patients experiencing \u2265 1 exacerbation, mortality, or need for oral steroids and antibiotics did not seem to be impacted by IDM, but some analyses were underpowered.",

These effects include:\n1. Improved lung function: IDM interventions often include pulmonary rehabilitation, which has been shown to improve lung function and exercise tolerance in people with COPD.\n2. Reduced symptoms: IDM interventions can help reduce symptoms such as shortness of breath, cough, and fatigue, which are common in people with COPD.\n3. Improved quality of life: By managing symptoms and improving lung function, IDM interventions can improve a person's overall quality of life and ability to perform daily activities.\n4. Reduced hospitalizations: IDM interventions can help reduce the number of hospitalizations and emergency department visits for people with COPD.\n5. Improved medication adherence: IDM interventions often include education and support to help people with COPD better understand and manage their medications, leading to improved adherence and more effective disease management.\n6. Improved coordination of care: IDM interventions often involve a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals working together to provide comprehensive care, which can improve coordination of care and reduce the risk of complications.\nIt's important to note that the effectiveness of IDM interventions can vary depending on the specific intervention and the individual's severity of COPD. It's important to work closely with a healthcare provider to develop a personalized IDM plan.",

However, its efficacy and safety in inducing remission in adults with refractory ulcerative colitis are still being studied and debated.\nSome studies have suggested that tacrolimus may be effective in inducing remission in patients with refractory ulcerative colitis who have failed conventional therapies. For example, a study published in the Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology found that tacrolimus therapy led to clinical remission in 58% of patients with refractory ulcerative colitis. Another study published in the Journal of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases found that tacrolimus was effective in inducing remission in 44% of patients with refractory ulcerative colitis.\nHowever, other studies have found conflicting results. A systematic review and meta-analysis published in the Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology found that the evidence for the use of tacrolimus in ulcerative colitis is limited and that more research is needed to determine its efficacy and safety.\nIt's important to note that tacrolimus can have serious side effects, including infections, nephrotoxicity, and hyperkalemia. Therefore, its use in clinical practice should be carefully considered and monitored by a healthcare professional.\nIn summary, while some studies suggest that tacrolimus may be effective in inducing remission in adults with refractory ulcerative colitis, more research is needed to confirm its efficacy and safety. Patients with refractory ulcerative colitis should discuss the potential benefits and risks of tacrolimus therapy with their healthcare provider.",

Studies have consistently demonstrated that antihypertensive medications, particularly those that target the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), can reduce the risk of cognitive decline and dementia in hypertensive individuals. Additionally, some studies suggest that blood pressure-lowering drugs may have a protective effect on cognitive function in older adults, even in the absence of hypertension. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings and establish the optimal treatment strategies for preventing cognitive impairment and dementia.",

A systematic review and meta-analysis published in 2018 found that TCCD had a pooled sensitivity of 84% and a pooled specificity of 88% for detecting intracranial arterial stenosis or occlusion in patients with acute ischemic stroke (1). However, the study also noted significant heterogeneity between the included studies, which may have influenced the results.\nAnother study published in 2020 found that TCCD had a sensitivity of 90.9% and a specificity of 94.7% for detecting stenosis or occlusion in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) within 72 hours of stroke onset (2). However, the study had a relatively small sample size and may not be generalizable to all patients with acute ischemic stroke.\nIt is important to note that TCCD is not a perfect test, and its accuracy may be affected by various factors, such as the skill of the operator, the quality of the equipment, and the severity of the stroke. Therefore, TCCD should be used in conjunction with other diagnostic tools, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) angiography, to improve diagnostic accuracy.\nIn summary, while the accuracy of TCCD for detecting stenosis or occlusion of intracranial arteries after acute ischemic stroke is generally moderate to high, it is not a perfect test, and its results should be interpreted with caution and in conjunction with other diagnostic tools.\nReferences:\n1.

According to a systematic review and meta-analysis published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, corticosteroids reduced the risk of death and disability in patients with tuberculous meningitis by 27% and 23%, respectively, compared to those who did not receive corticosteroids. However, the review also noted that the quality of the evidence was generally low and that further research is needed to confirm these findings. It's important to note that corticosteroids should only be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional and in conjunction with appropriate antituberculous therapy.",

Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that can help maintain a healthy gut microbiome, which is important for the development and function of various bodily systems, including the immune system.\nStudies have found that probiotics can help reduce the risk of preterm birth, which is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Probiotics have also been shown to reduce the risk of other complications in preterm infants, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious condition that can cause damage to the intestines.\nIt's important to note that not all probiotics are the same, and some strains have been found to be more effective than others in preventing morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. For example, the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any supplements during pregnancy, including probiotics, to ensure safety and effectiveness. Additionally, it's important to note that while probiotics can help reduce the risk of complications, they are not a guarantee against them, and other factors such as proper prenatal care, a healthy diet, and a safe delivery are also important for a healthy pregnancy and baby.",
