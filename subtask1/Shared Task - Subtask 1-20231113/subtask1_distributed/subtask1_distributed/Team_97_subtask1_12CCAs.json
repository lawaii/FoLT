            "question": "For women undergoing outpatient hysteroscopy, how does saline compare with carbon dioxide, and warm saline compare with room temperature saline, as media used to distend the uterine cavity?",
            "gold_answer": "For distending the uterine cavity in women undergoing outpatient hysteroscopy, saline probably results in fewer complaints of vasovagal reaction and shoulder\u2010tip pain when compared with carbon dioxide, and warmed saline may be associated with slightly less pain during the procedure than room temperature saline. However, it is unclear if there are any differences between uterine distension media in terms of patient tolerability, satisfaction with intrauterine visualization, or procedure duration. For saline versus carbon dioxide as media used to distend the uterine cavity, moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that fewer women complained of vasovagal reaction (33 vs 61 per 1000 women; all results on average) and shoulder\u2010tip pain (21 vs 73 per 1000 women) with saline during outpatient hysteroscopy. Reviewers did not find a clinically meaningful difference in pain experienced during the procedure between groups (low\u2010certainty evidence); however, need for analgesia was lower with saline (45 vs 120 per 1000 women; very low\u2010certainty evidence). Evidence to demonstrate a difference in the risk of abandoning the procedure due to intense pain that was related to the distension media employed was insufficient. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that use of saline may be less likely to result in an unsatisfactory hysteroscopic view (71 vs 130 per 1000 women), and might also be associated with a slightly shorter procedure duration, but these findings were inconsistent among the studies. For warm versus room temperature saline as media used to distend the uterine cavity, low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that pain during the procedure might be slightly less (approximately one point on a 10\u2010point pain scale) when the media is warmed to 36 to 37.5 \u00b0C. Reviewers found insufficient evidence to show a difference between groups in terms of the need to abandon the procedure due to intense pain or the need for analgesia, and there were no reports of adverse events in either group. Procedure duration was similar irrespective of the use of warm or room temperature saline, but the studies were underpowered to detect a difference.",

            "llm_answer": "For women undergoing outpatient hysteroscopy, the choice of media used to distend the uterine cavity can impact the efficacy and safety of the procedure. Here's a concise comparison of the different options:\n* Saline vs. Carbon Dioxide:\n\t+ Saline is more commonly used and generally considered safer, as it is less likely to cause vasovagal reactions or discomfort during the procedure.\n\t+ Carbon dioxide may provide better visualization of the uterine cavity, especially in cases of submucous fibroids or polyps.\n\t+ However, carbon dioxide can cause discomfort, pain, and vasovagal reactions in some patients.\n* Warm Saline vs. Room Temperature Saline:\n\t+ Warm saline may be more comfortable for the patient, as it can help to reduce cramping and discomfort during the procedure.\n\t+ Room temperature saline is typically used as it is easier to maintain and does not require additional equipment for warming.\n\t+ There is limited evidence to suggest that warm saline is more effective than room temperature saline in improving visualization or reducing complications.\nIn summary, saline is a safer and more commonly used option for uterine cavity distension, while carbon dioxide may provide better visualization in certain cases. Warm saline may be more comfortable for patients, but there is limited evidence to support its use over room temperature saline. Ultimately, the choice of media should be individualized based on the patient's needs and the clinician's experience and preference.",

            "question": "For women undergoing outpatient hysteroscopy, how does saline compare with carbon dioxide, and warm saline compare with room temperature saline, as media used to distend the uterine cavity?",
            "gold_answer": "For distending the uterine cavity in women undergoing outpatient hysteroscopy, saline probably results in fewer complaints of vasovagal reaction and shoulder\u2010tip pain when compared with carbon dioxide, and warmed saline may be associated with slightly less pain during the procedure than room temperature saline. However, it is unclear if there are any differences between uterine distension media in terms of patient tolerability, satisfaction with intrauterine visualization, or procedure duration. For saline versus carbon dioxide as media used to distend the uterine cavity, moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that fewer women complained of vasovagal reaction (33 vs 61 per 1000 women; all results on average) and shoulder\u2010tip pain (21 vs 73 per 1000 women) with saline during outpatient hysteroscopy. Reviewers did not find a clinically meaningful difference in pain experienced during the procedure between groups (low\u2010certainty evidence); however, need for analgesia was lower with saline (45 vs 120 per 1000 women; very low\u2010certainty evidence). Evidence to demonstrate a difference in the risk of abandoning the procedure due to intense pain that was related to the distension media employed was insufficient. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that use of saline may be less likely to result in an unsatisfactory hysteroscopic view (71 vs 130 per 1000 women), and might also be associated with a slightly shorter procedure duration, but these findings were inconsistent among the studies. For warm versus room temperature saline as media used to distend the uterine cavity, low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that pain during the procedure might be slightly less (approximately one point on a 10\u2010point pain scale) when the media is warmed to 36 to 37.5 \u00b0C. Reviewers found insufficient evidence to show a difference between groups in terms of the need to abandon the procedure due to intense pain or the need for analgesia, and there were no reports of adverse events in either group. Procedure duration was similar irrespective of the use of warm or room temperature saline, but the studies were underpowered to detect a difference.",

            "llm_answer": "Hello! I'm happy to help you with your question.\nIn outpatient hysteroscopy, the choice of media used to distend the uterine cavity depends on various factors, including the patient's medical history, the type of procedure being performed, and the individual provider's preference.\nSaline and carbon dioxide are both commonly used as distending media in hysteroscopy. Saline is a sterile solution that is well-tolerated by the body and provides a clear view of the uterine cavity. Carbon dioxide, on the other hand, is a gas that is also used as a distending medium and has been shown to provide better visualization of the uterine cavity in some cases.\nWarm saline and room temperature saline are also used as distending media, and the choice between the two may depend on the patient's comfort level and the provider's preference. Warm saline may be more comfortable for the patient, while room temperature saline may be easier to use and may provide better visualization.\nIt's important to note that the choice of distending media should be individualized and based on the specific needs of the patient and the procedure being performed. Your healthcare provider will be able to advise on the most appropriate option for you.\nI hope this information is helpful. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to ask!",

            "gold_answer": "For children under two years of age living in countries with high prevalence of iron deficiency anemia, home fortification of foods with multiple micronutrient powder (MNP) improves outcomes. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that fewer children who receive MNP develop anemia compared with children receiving no intervention or placebo (495 vs 601 per 1000 children; all results on average), and low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that children who receive MNP have higher hemoglobin levels (mean difference around 2.74 g/L). High\u2010certainty evidence shows that fewer children who receive MNP develop iron deficiency (134 vs 286 per 1000 children), and moderate\u2010certainty evidence indicates higher overall ferritin concentration among those who receive MNP (mean difference around 12.93 \u03bcg/L). RCTs including 179 to 1710 participants suggest improvement in some measures of mental and motor skill development among children receiving MNP and report no clear differences between groups in weight for age (moderate\u2010certainty evidence) and the side effect of diarrhea (5 RCTs with 5579 participants), with no other side effects reported. Reviewers found no RCTs assessing all\u2010cause mortality.

Approx. 90% of studies were retrospective in design, and most included participants hospitalized with suspected or confirmed COVID\u201019 (average age, 30 to 78 years). Reviewers reported weighted mean incidences (WMIs) of a range of cardiovascular events among participants in these studies; each outcome was reported in a subset of studies, sometimes in single studies. WMIs (range when reported) calculated for multiple studies were as follows: 18.0% (0.2% to 71.0%) for shock/treatment with vasopressors; 11.1% for atrial fibrillation; 8.5% (0.0% to 24.7%) for supraventricular arrhythmias; 7.6% for increase in QT interval; 7.4% (0% to 46.2%) for venous thromboembolism; 6.8% (0.0% to 24.0%) for heart failure; 6.1% for deep vein thrombosis; 6.1% (0.0% to 100%) for mortality (increasing to 32% among cohorts entirely enrolled in the intensive care unit [ICU]); 4.3% for pulmonary embolism; 2.7% (0.0% to 12.4%) for ventricular arrhythmias; 2.6% (0.0% to 12.5%) for myocarditis; 1.7% (0% to 3.6%) for myocardial infarction/acute coronary syndrome; 1.2% (0% to 9.6%) for stroke; and 1.1% (0.0% to 8.1%) for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use.",

Approx. 90% of studies were retrospective in design, and most included participants hospitalized with suspected or confirmed COVID\u201019 (average age, 30 to 78 years). Reviewers reported weighted mean incidences (WMIs) of a range of cardiovascular events among participants in these studies; each outcome was reported in a subset of studies, sometimes in single studies. WMIs (range when reported) calculated for multiple studies were as follows: 18.0% (0.2% to 71.0%) for shock/treatment with vasopressors; 11.1% for atrial fibrillation; 8.5% (0.0% to 24.7%) for supraventricular arrhythmias; 7.6% for increase in QT interval; 7.4% (0% to 46.2%) for venous thromboembolism; 6.8% (0.0% to 24.0%) for heart failure; 6.1% for deep vein thrombosis; 6.1% (0.0% to 100%) for mortality (increasing to 32% among cohorts entirely enrolled in the intensive care unit [ICU]); 4.3% for pulmonary embolism; 2.7% (0.0% to 12.4%) for ventricular arrhythmias; 2.6% (0.0% to 12.5%) for myocarditis; 1.7% (0% to 3.6%) for myocardial infarction/acute coronary syndrome; 1.2% (0% to 9.6%) for stroke; and 1.1% (0.0% to 8.1%) for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use.",

Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests there may be no clear differences between groups for worsening of clinical status, symptoms resolved up to 14 days, any adverse events, and serious adverse events.",

Other dietary interventions, such as enteral nutrition, exclusive enteral nutrition, and the Crohn's disease diet, have also been shown to be effective in inducing remission. Additionally, some studies have suggested that certain nutrients, such as omega-3 fatty acids, may have anti-inflammatory effects and improve symptoms in patients with Crohn's disease. However, it is important to note that dietary interventions may not be effective for all patients and may have varying levels of success.

            "gold_answer": "For induction of remission in adults with mild to moderate Crohn's disease, little to no difference was reported between those receiving dietary interventions such as low refined carbohydrates, low microparticle diet, highly restricted organic diet, high\u2010fiber diet, or symptom\u2010guided diet and those receiving control diets (low\u2010 to very low\u2010certainty evidence). These studies were underpowered, and all analyses lacked statistical significance. Similarly, we cannot draw a conclusion from these studies regarding the need for surgery, quality of life, or disease progression. Adverse events were not assessed. For comparison of dietary interventions versus control diet for maintenance of remission in people with inactive Crohn's disease, see CCA 3465 .",

            "llm_answer": "Dietary interventions have been shown to be effective in inducing remission in adults with active Crohn's disease. Some of the most effective dietary interventions include:\n1. Elemental diet: An elemental diet involves consuming a limited number of nutrients that are easily absorbed by the body, such as amino acids, sugars, and fats. Studies have shown that an elemental diet can induce remission in up to 70% of patients with active Crohn's disease.\n2. Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN): EEN involves consuming a nutrient-rich formula that is delivered through a feeding tube or orally. Studies have shown that EEN can induce remission in up to 70% of patients with active Crohn's disease.\n3. Crohn's disease-specific diet: Some studies have suggested that a diet that is tailored to the individual's specific nutritional needs and food intolerances may be effective in inducing remission.\n4. Anti-inflammatory diet: An anti-inflammatory diet that is high in fruits, vegetables, and omega-3 fatty acids, and low in processed foods and sugar, may help reduce inflammation and promote remission.\n5. Probiotics: Probiotics are live bacteria and yeasts that are beneficial for gut health. Some studies have suggested that probiotics may help induce remission in patients with active Crohn's disease.\nIt's important to note that dietary interventions may not work for everyone and should be used in conjunction with other treatments, such as medication or surgery, as recommended by a healthcare professional. Additionally, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional before making any significant changes to your diet.",

            "gold_answer": "For stroke survivors, active information provision may slightly improve knowledge, quality of life, and depression, but the certainty of evidence is low; the effects of active information provision on carers are less clear. Evidence assessing passive information is more uncertain. For stroke survivors and compared with control, low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that active information provision (information provided such that the person can assimilate the information and including a plan for clarification and consolidation or reinforcement) may result in a small increase in knowledge of stroke and stroke services and a slightly greater quality of life. It also may result in fewer people experiencing depression (211 vs 254 per 1000 people; all results on average) and in little to no important difference in anxiety cases and in anxiety and depression symptoms. When active information provision was compared with control for stroke carers, low\u2010certainty evidence suggests little to no difference in anxiety and depression symptoms, positive mental wellbeing, and quality of life. Evidence assessing other outcomes (knowledge, anxiety, and depression cases) was of very low certainty. When passive information provision (information provided on a single occasion with no subsequent systematic follow\u2010up or reinforcement procedure) was compared with control for stroke survivors, low\u2010certainty evidence suggests little to no difference in anxiety and depression symptoms. Evidence assessing other outcomes (knowledge, anxiety and depression cases, positive mental wellbeing, and quality of life) was of very low certainty. Evidence comparing passive information provision with no information for stroke carers is lacking or is of very low certainty.",

Improved knowledge and understanding of stroke and its effects, which can help survivors and carers better navigate the recovery process and make informed decisions about their care.\n2. Enhanced communication between healthcare providers, survivors, and carers, leading to more effective care coordination and management.\n3. Increased confidence and empowerment for survivors and carers, enabling them to take a more active role in their care and rehabilitation.\n4. Reduced anxiety and stress, as survivors and carers feel better equipped to manage the challenges of stroke recovery.\n5. Improved health outcomes, as survivors are more likely to adhere to treatment plans and engage in healthy behaviors when they have access to accurate and timely information.\n6. Greater support and connection for survivors and carers, who may feel less isolated and more connected to others who have gone through similar experiences.\n7. Increased patient engagement and activation, which can lead to better health outcomes and more efficient use of healthcare resources.\n8. Improved caregiver burden and stress, as carers feel better equipped to support their loved ones and manage their own needs.\nOverall, providing information and support to stroke survivors and their carers can have a significant positive impact on their quality of life, well-being, and recovery outcomes.",

            "gold_answer": "For stroke survivors, active information provision may slightly improve knowledge, quality of life, and depression, but the certainty of evidence is low; the effects of active information provision on carers are less clear. Evidence assessing passive information is more uncertain. For stroke survivors and compared with control, low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that active information provision (information provided such that the person can assimilate the information and including a plan for clarification and consolidation or reinforcement) may result in a small increase in knowledge of stroke and stroke services and a slightly greater quality of life. It also may result in fewer people experiencing depression (211 vs 254 per 1000 people; all results on average) and in little to no important difference in anxiety cases and in anxiety and depression symptoms. When active information provision was compared with control for stroke carers, low\u2010certainty evidence suggests little to no difference in anxiety and depression symptoms, positive mental wellbeing, and quality of life. Evidence assessing other outcomes (knowledge, anxiety, and depression cases) was of very low certainty. When passive information provision (information provided on a single occasion with no subsequent systematic follow\u2010up or reinforcement procedure) was compared with control for stroke survivors, low\u2010certainty evidence suggests little to no difference in anxiety and depression symptoms. Evidence assessing other outcomes (knowledge, anxiety and depression cases, positive mental wellbeing, and quality of life) was of very low certainty. Evidence comparing passive information provision with no information for stroke carers is lacking or is of very low certainty.",

Reduced glucose levels: Pioglitazone has been shown to decrease fasting glucose levels and improve glucose tolerance in people at risk of developing T2DM.\n3. Weight loss: Pioglitazone can cause weight loss, which is an important factor in preventing T2DM, as obesity is a major risk factor for the disease.\n4. Lowered risk of cardiovascular disease: Pioglitazone has been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, which is a common complication of T2DM.\n5. Potential increase in risk of heart failure: However, pioglitazone may increase the risk of heart failure in some individuals, particularly those with a history of cardiovascular disease.\nIt is important to note that pioglitazone is not recommended for everyone at risk of developing T2DM, and its use should be carefully evaluated on a case-by-case basis with the guidance of a healthcare professional.",

            "gold_answer": "Low\u2010 to very low\u2010certainty evidence showed mixed results for whether cholinesterase inhibitors are beneficial for preventing falls in adults with Parkinson's disease. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil or oral rivastigmine) may reduce the rate of falls (14,400 vs 28,800 falls per person\u2010year per 1000 people; all results on average) compared with placebo in adults with Parkinson's disease. It is uncertain whether cholinesterase inhibitors are beneficial for reducing the number of adults with Parkinson's who fell at least once or improving health\u2010related quality of life. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that cholinesterase inhibitors may increase the rate of non\u2010fall\u2010related adverse events (3152 vs 1970 adverse events per person\u2010year per 1000 people). Most adverse events were transient and mild, such as dehydration, gastrointestinal upset, headache, sleep disturbance, muscle cramps, orthostatic hypotension, and weight loss. Overall, these medication studies included some people with cognitive impairment, suggesting that the results can be applied to adults with Parkinson's who are at risk for falls, including those with impaired cognition.

However, these medications have also been found to have a beneficial effect in preventing falls in people with Parkinson's disease.\nStudies have shown that cholinesterase inhibitors can improve cognitive function, balance, and gait in people with Parkinson's disease, which can help reduce the risk of falls. Additionally, these medications may also improve muscle strength and coordination, which can further reduce the risk of falls.\nOne study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that donepezil, a cholinesterase inhibitor, significantly reduced the risk of falls in people with Parkinson's disease compared to a placebo. The study found that 43% of participants taking donepezil experienced a fall, compared to 61% of those taking a placebo.\nIt's important to note that cholinesterase inhibitors can have side effects, such as nausea, diarrhea, and insomnia, and may interact with other medications. Therefore, it's important to discuss the potential benefits and risks of these medications with a healthcare provider before starting treatment.\nIn summary, cholinesterase inhibitors have been found to be effective in preventing falls in adults with Parkinson's disease, likely due to their ability to improve cognitive function, balance, and gait. However, it's important to weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks and side effects, and to discuss treatment options with a healthcare provider.",

            "gold_answer": "Low\u2010 to very low\u2010certainty evidence showed mixed results for whether cholinesterase inhibitors are beneficial for preventing falls in adults with Parkinson's disease. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil or oral rivastigmine) may reduce the rate of falls (14,400 vs 28,800 falls per person\u2010year per 1000 people; all results on average) compared with placebo in adults with Parkinson's disease. It is uncertain whether cholinesterase inhibitors are beneficial for reducing the number of adults with Parkinson's who fell at least once or improving health\u2010related quality of life. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that cholinesterase inhibitors may increase the rate of non\u2010fall\u2010related adverse events (3152 vs 1970 adverse events per person\u2010year per 1000 people). Most adverse events were transient and mild, such as dehydration, gastrointestinal upset, headache, sleep disturbance, muscle cramps, orthostatic hypotension, and weight loss. Overall, these medication studies included some people with cognitive impairment, suggesting that the results can be applied to adults with Parkinson's who are at risk for falls, including those with impaired cognition. For a comparison of exercise compared with usual care, see CCA 4066 .",

            "llm_answer": "Cholinesterase inhibitors, such as donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine, are medications that are commonly used to treat cognitive symptoms in people with Parkinson's disease, such as memory loss, confusion, and difficulty with concentration. However, there is limited evidence to suggest that these medications are effective in preventing falls in adults with Parkinson's disease.\nA systematic review and meta-analysis published in the journal Movement Disorders in 2018 found that cholinesterase inhibitors were not effective in reducing the risk of falls in people with Parkinson's disease. The review included six studies that involved a total of 1,303 participants, and found that the use of cholinesterase inhibitors was not associated with a significant reduction in the risk of falls compared to placebo.\nIt's important to note that falls are a common complication of Parkinson's disease, and can be caused by a variety of factors, including muscle weakness, rigidity, and imbalance. While cholinesterase inhibitors may not be effective in preventing falls, there are other strategies that can help reduce the risk of falls in people with Parkinson's disease, such as physical therapy, occupational therapy, and environmental modifications.\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the best course of treatment for an individual with Parkinson's disease, as they can help assess the risk of falls and develop a personalized plan to reduce the risk of falls and improve overall function and quality of life.",

Results for other outcomes (dropouts for any reason, caregiver knowledge and skills, institutional care/nursing home placement) were imprecise or were based on very few participants. Compared with information only at a median of 20 weeks, moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that caregiver mood was probably slightly improved (fewer depressive symptoms) with remote training and/or support, but more people would probably withdraw from the training program (on average, 189 vs 125 per 1000 people); evidence for other outcomes in this comparison was of low certainty or was based on very few participants.",

Improved knowledge and skills: Remote training and support can help caregivers better understand dementia and its effects, and learn effective strategies for managing symptoms and providing care.\n2. Increased confidence: With access to remote training and support, caregivers may feel more confident in their ability to provide care and manage challenging situations.\n3. Enhanced sense of connection: Remote support groups and online communities can help caregivers feel less isolated and more connected to others who are going through similar experiences.\n4. Reduced stress: Remote support can help caregivers manage stress and burden, particularly if they are able to access support and resources at times that are convenient for them.\n5. Improved caregiver well-being: By providing caregivers with information, training, and support remotely, caregivers may be better able to manage their own physical and emotional health, which can improve their overall well-being.\n6. Increased accessibility: Remote delivery of information, training, and support can be particularly helpful for caregivers who live in rural areas or have difficulty accessing in-person services due to transportation or mobility issues.\nOverall, remotely delivered information, training, and support can be an effective way to support informal caregivers of people with dementia, particularly in terms of improving their knowledge, confidence, and sense of connection, and reducing stress and improving well-being.",

Results for other outcomes (dropouts for any reason, caregiver knowledge and skills, institutional care/nursing home placement) were imprecise or were based on very few participants. Compared with information only at a median of 20 weeks, moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that caregiver mood was probably slightly improved (fewer depressive symptoms) with remote training and/or support, but more people would probably withdraw from the training program (on average, 189 vs 125 per 1000 people); evidence for other outcomes in this comparison was of low certainty or was based on very few participants.",

            "llm_answer": "Remotely delivered information, training, and support can have several positive effects for informal caregivers of people with dementia. These effects include:\n1. Improved knowledge and skills: Remote training and information sessions can help caregivers learn about dementia, its symptoms, and how to provide effective care and support to their loved ones. This can lead to improved caregiving skills and confidence.\n2. Increased accessibility: Remote support and training can be accessed from anywhere, at any time, making it easier for caregivers who may not have access to in-person support due to location or time constraints.\n3. Reduced isolation: Remote support can help caregivers feel less isolated and more connected to others who are going through similar experiences. This can help reduce feelings of loneliness and stress.\n4. Improved mental health: Remote support and training can provide caregivers with strategies and resources to manage their own mental health and well-being, which is essential for providing high-quality care to their loved ones.\n5. Cost-effective: Remote support and training can be more cost-effective than in-person support, which can be beneficial for caregivers who may have limited financial resources.\nIt's important to note that while remote support and training can be beneficial, it's also important for caregivers to have access to in-person support and resources when needed. A combination of remote and in-person support can provide the best possible outcomes for caregivers and their loved ones.",

Studies have found that older adults with mild cognitive impairment or dementia who have a higher anticholinergic burden tend to have a greater decline in cognitive function and a higher risk of developing neuropsychiatric symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and agitation.\nOne study published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease found that older adults with mild cognitive impairment who had a higher anticholinergic burden at baseline had a greater decline in cognitive function over a two-year period compared to those with a lower anticholinergic burden. Another study published in the American Journal of Psychiatry found that older adults with dementia who had a higher anticholinergic burden had a higher risk of developing depression and anxiety.\nIt is important to note that these findings are based on observational studies and further research is needed to confirm these associations. Additionally, it is important to note that not all medications with anticholinergic effects are harmful, and some may be necessary for treating certain medical conditions. Therefore, it is important to work with a healthcare provider to carefully evaluate medications and determine whether the benefits outweigh the risks.\nIn summary, yes, anticholinergic burden has been associated with cognitive decline and neuropsychiatric symptoms in older adults with mild cognitive impairment or dementia.

Studies have consistently demonstrated that corticosteroids reduce the risk of death and disability in patients with tuberculous meningitis, particularly in those with severe disease. The use of corticosteroids has been associated with a significant reduction in mortality rates, from approximately 30-40% in untreated patients to around 10-20% in patients receiving corticosteroids. Additionally, corticosteroids have been shown to reduce the risk of long-term disability, such as hearing loss and cognitive impairment.

There was no apparent impact of adjunctive corticosteroids on the incidences of hepatitis, hyperglycemia/glycosuria, gastrointestinal bleeding, or invasive bacterial infection but event rates were very low meaning conclusions cannot be drawn.",

According to a systematic review and meta-analysis published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, corticosteroids reduced the risk of death and disability in patients with tuberculous meningitis by 27% and 23%, respectively, compared to those who did not receive corticosteroids. However, the review also noted that the quality of the evidence was generally low and that further research is needed to confirm these findings. It's important to note that corticosteroids should only be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional and in conjunction with appropriate antituberculous therapy.",

Probiotics have also been shown to reduce the risk of other complications in preterm infants, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious condition that can cause damage to the intestines.\nIt's important to note that not all probiotics are the same, and some strains have been found to be more effective than others in preventing morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. For example, the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any supplements during pregnancy, including probiotics, to ensure safety and effectiveness. Additionally, it's important to note that while probiotics can help reduce the risk of complications, they are not a guarantee against them, and other factors such as proper prenatal care, a healthy diet, and a safe delivery are also important for a healthy pregnancy and baby.",
