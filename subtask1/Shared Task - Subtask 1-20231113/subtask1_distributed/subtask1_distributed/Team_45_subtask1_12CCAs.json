            "question": "In preterm or low birth weight infants, do cyclo\u2010oxygenase inhibitors (COX\u2010I) help prevent morbidity and mortality?",
            "gold_answer": "Probably fewer infants experience severe intraventricular hemorrhage and surgical patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) closure with indomethacin and ibuprofen than with placebo, with minimal to no important difference in necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). The effects of these drugs for other outcomes and paracetamol (acetaminophen) for all outcomes are less clear. Reviewers conducted a network meta\u2010analysis to assess the effects of COX\u2010I in preterm infants. High\u2010certainty evidence shows minimal to no important difference in NEC between indomethacin or ibuprofen and placebo. Based on low\u2010 to moderate\u2010certainty evidence, there is minimal to no important difference between these drugs and placebo in mortality. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that probably fewer infants experience severe intraventricular hemorrhage with indomethacin than with placebo (43 vs 127 per 1000 infants, all results on average), but a clear difference was not seen between ibuprofen and placebo due to imprecise results. Probably fewer infants undergo surgical PDA closure with indomethacin (52 vs 87 per 1000 infants) or ibuprofen (66 vs 87 per 1000 infants) than with placebo; there is probably minimal to no important difference in gastrointestinal perforation between indomethacin and placebo. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests minimal to no important difference in chronic lung disease (CLD) between indomethacin or ibuprofen and placebo, and also in cerebral palsy between indomethacin and placebo. Fewer infants may experience oliguria with indomethacin (52 vs 87 per 1000 infants) or ibuprofen (66 vs 87 per 1000 infants) than with placebo. When available, the results for paracetamol were imprecise or very uncertain, or both. No study assessed major neurodevelopmental disability. Ibuprofen appears to be the best active treatment for reduction of surgical PDA closure, NEC, and CLD, but worse than indomethacin for gastrointestinal perforation.",

Given the limitations of the RCT data, no conclusions can be drawn as to the benefits or harms of this intervention. For women undergoing elective cesarean section from 37 weeks' gestation and receiving betamethasone, moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that probably fewer infants born to these mothers were admitted to neonatal special care for respiratory morbidity, compared to infants born to women undergoing elective cesarean section from 37 weeks' gestation and not receiving betamethasone (on average, 28 vs 62 per 1000 infants). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that fewer infants of mothers receiving betamethasone had respiratory distress syndrome but more had transient tachypnea, although differences between groups did not reach statistical significance for either outcome. Length of stay in neonatal intensive care unit may be reduced by approximately two days with betamethasone (based on 942 infants). The certainty of evidence regarding need for mechanical ventilation is very low and no cases of neonatal sepsis and perinatal death were reported (based on 475 infants).

Improved patient outcomes: EBP-informed rehabilitation has been associated with better functional recovery, reduced disability, and improved quality of life for stroke survivors.\n2. Enhanced clinical decision-making: EBP-informed rehabilitation promotes the use of research evidence to guide clinical decision-making, leading to more effective and efficient treatment strategies.\n3. Increased efficiency: EBP-informed rehabilitation streamlines care processes, reduces unnecessary interventions, and optimizes resource allocation, resulting in more efficient use of healthcare resources.\n4. Better patient engagement: EBP-informed rehabilitation involves patients in the goal-setting process, promoting greater engagement and motivation, which can lead to better treatment outcomes.\n5. Greater consistency: EBP-informed rehabilitation promotes the use of standardized protocols and guidelines, ensuring greater consistency in care delivery across healthcare professionals and settings.\n6. Reduced variability: EBP-informed rehabilitation reduces variability in care delivery, as clinicians are less likely to rely on intuition or anecdotal evidence, and instead, follow evidence-based guidelines.\n7. Improved patient safety: EBP-informed rehabilitation promotes the use of evidence-based interventions that have been shown to be safe and effective, reducing the risk of adverse events and complications.\n8. Better allocation of resources: EBP-informed rehabilitation identifies the most effective interventions and allocates resources accordingly, reducing wasteful spending on ineffective treatments.\n9. Enhanced professional development: EBP-informed rehabilitation promotes ongoing professional development and lifelong learning among healthcare professionals, fostering a culture of excellence in care delivery.\n10.

            "llm_answer": "Evidence-based practice (EBP) is an approach to healthcare that emphasizes the use of evidence from research and patient preferences to guide decision-making. In the context of stroke rehabilitation, EBP involves using research studies and clinical guidelines to inform treatment decisions, rather than relying solely on clinical experience or tradition.\nCompared to treatment as usual, stroke rehabilitation informed by EBP has been shown to have several benefits for stroke survivors and healthcare professionals. These benefits include:\n1. Improved patient outcomes: Studies have consistently shown that EBP-informed stroke rehabilitation leads to better patient outcomes, such as improved functional ability, reduced disability, and enhanced quality of life.\n2. Increased efficiency: EBP helps healthcare professionals identify the most effective interventions and avoid unnecessary or ineffective treatments, which can reduce the duration and cost of rehabilitation.\n3. Better use of resources: By focusing on evidence-based interventions, healthcare professionals can make the most of limited resources, such as time and budget, to provide the best possible care.\n4. Enhanced patient safety: EBP helps healthcare professionals identify and avoid potentially harmful or ineffective treatments, which can reduce the risk of adverse events and patient harm.\n5. Improved patient engagement: EBP involves patients in the decision-making process and takes their preferences and values into account, which can lead to higher patient satisfaction and engagement in their rehabilitation.\n6. Increased professional satisfaction: Healthcare professionals who practice EBP report higher job satisfaction and confidence in their clinical decision-making.\n7. Better allocation of resources: EBP helps healthcare professionals identify the most effective interventions and allocate resources accordingly, which can lead to better use of resources and improved patient outcomes.\n8. Reduced variation in practice: EBP helps to reduce variation in clinical practice, which can lead to more consistent and effective care across different healthcare settings and providers.\nIn summary, stroke rehabilitation informed by EBP has been shown to have numerous benefits for both stroke survivors and healthcare professionals, including improved",

            "gold_answer": "Self\u2010management strategies may have some benefit for seizure management in children/adolescents; however, this effect was not consistent across all outcomes, and so no firm conclusions can be drawn. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that the number of seizures experienced by children and adolescents with epilepsy is probably lower with self\u2010management training compared with usual care. More children/adolescents may also achieve seizure control and seizure cure at 12 months with self\u2010management strategies than with usual care (low\u2010certainty evidence; 867 vs 717 per 1000 children/adolescents and 583 vs 383 per 1000 children/adolescents, respectively; all results on average). In contrast, low\u2010certainty evidence suggests there is little to no effect of self\u2010management training on seizure severity (defined as frequency and duration of seizures) compared with usual care (373 vs 250 per 1000 children/adolescents). Self\u2010management strategies probably improve drug adherence at three months (429 vs 159 per 1000 children/adolescents) and increase the number of children who had knowledge of epilepsy at three months (moderate\u2010certainty evidence). However, there may be little to no effect on self\u2010efficacy related to seizure management and in self\u2010perception of epilepsy on quality of life at three months (low\u2010certainty evidence). No single service delivery intervention was consistently effective across the different outcomes. While the programs did not show any negative impacts on children or adolescents with epilepsy, there were differences in how outcomes were collected, thus no single program can be recommended as more effective than the others.",

            "gold_answer": "Self\u2010management strategies may have some benefit for seizure management in children/adolescents; however, this effect was not consistent across all outcomes, and so no firm conclusions can be drawn. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that the number of seizures experienced by children and adolescents with epilepsy is probably lower with self\u2010management training compared with usual care. More children/adolescents may also achieve seizure control and seizure cure at 12 months with self\u2010management strategies than with usual care (low\u2010certainty evidence; 867 vs 717 per 1000 children/adolescents and 583 vs 383 per 1000 children/adolescents, respectively; all results on average). In contrast, low\u2010certainty evidence suggests there is little to no effect of self\u2010management training on seizure severity (defined as frequency and duration of seizures) compared with usual care (373 vs 250 per 1000 children/adolescents). Self\u2010management strategies probably improve drug adherence at three months (429 vs 159 per 1000 children/adolescents) and increase the number of children who had knowledge of epilepsy at three months (moderate\u2010certainty evidence). However, there may be little to no effect on self\u2010efficacy related to seizure management and in self\u2010perception of epilepsy on quality of life at three months (low\u2010certainty evidence). No single service delivery intervention was consistently effective across the different outcomes. While the programs did not show any negative impacts on children or adolescents with epilepsy, there were differences in how outcomes were collected, thus no single program can be recommended as more effective than the others.",

            "llm_answer": "Interventions aimed at improving self-management for families with children and/or adolescents with epilepsy can have several positive effects. These may include:\n1. Improved seizure control: By educating families on seizure recognition, first aid, and proper medication management, interventions can help reduce the frequency and severity of seizures.\n2. Enhanced quality of life: Interventions can help families better manage the impact of epilepsy on their daily lives, leading to improved overall well-being and quality of life for both the child/adolescent and their caregivers.\n3. Increased confidence and independence: Self-management interventions can empower families to take control of their condition, reducing anxiety and improving their ability to cope with the challenges associated with epilepsy.\n4. Better communication and collaboration: Interventions can facilitate improved communication and collaboration between families, healthcare providers, and schools, ensuring that children and adolescents with epilepsy receive comprehensive and coordinated care.\n5. Reduced stigma and social isolation: By educating families and communities about epilepsy, interventions can help reduce stigma and promote social inclusion for children and adolescents with the condition.\n6. Improved mental health: Self-management interventions can also address the mental health and emotional well-being of families, helping to reduce stress, anxiety, and depression.\n7. Increased knowledge and skills: Interventions can provide families with the knowledge and skills necessary to navigate the healthcare system, advocate for their needs, and access available resources.\n8. Better transition to adulthood: Self-management interventions can help prepare adolescents with epilepsy for the transition to adulthood, ensuring they have the necessary skills and knowledge to manage their condition independently.\nIt is important to note that the effectiveness of interventions can vary depending on factors such as the type and intensity of the intervention, the family's needs and preferences, and the cultural and social context in which they are delivered.",

There was little to no difference between treatment groups for mortality, adverse effects, or hearing loss (very low\u2010 to low\u2010certainty evidence). Other adjuvant interventions including immunoglobulins, heparin, and pentoxifylline showed no significant benefit or harm in a small number of RCTs in adults and children with bacterial meningitis; however, all analyses were underpowered, preventing any firm conclusions.",

            "llm_answer": "Non-corticosteroid adjuvant therapies for acute bacterial meningitis (ABM) are treatments used in addition to antibiotics to help manage the symptoms and improve outcomes for patients. The effects of these therapies can vary depending on the specific treatment used, but some common effects include:\n1. Reduced inflammation: Non-corticosteroid adjuvants such as dexamethasone and other steroids can help reduce inflammation in the brain, which can help alleviate symptoms such as headache, fever, and confusion.\n2. Improved mental status: Adjuvant therapies such as anticonvulsants and sedatives can help manage seizures and agitation, improving the patient's mental status and reducing the risk of long-term neurological damage.\n3. Reduced risk of hearing loss: Certain adjuvants, such as antioxidants, have been shown to reduce the risk of hearing loss in patients with ABM.\n4. Improved survival rates: The use of non-corticosteroid adjuvants has been associated with improved survival rates for patients with ABM, particularly in those with severe disease.\n5. Reduced risk of complications: Adjuvant therapies can help reduce the risk of complications such as seizures, stroke, and hydrocephalus.\nIt is important to note that the choice of adjuvant therapy will depend on the specific needs of the patient and the severity of their illness. It is also important to note that while these therapies can be effective, they are not without risks and should be carefully monitored by a healthcare professional.",

Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that albendazole probably reduces seizure recurrence in people with single, non\u2010viable, and intraparenchymal cysts (138 vs 229 per 1000 people [most children]; all results on average). Reviewers reported results for people with non\u2010viable cysts and intraparenchymal cysts separately; both showed benefits of albendazole in terms of seizure recurrence (182 and 221, respectively, vs 333 per 1000 people; based on 507 and 681 participants, respectively). Moderate\u2010certainty evidence also shows that albendazole probably increases the number of people with complete radiological clearance of lesions (412 vs 337 per 1000 people) and provides benefits in terms of cyst evolution (725 vs 571 per 1000 people). Time to seizure remission, frequency of seizures, mortality, hospitalizations, and headaches were assessed in too few participants (103 to 470) to draw firm conclusions.",

            "gold_answer": "For people with neurocysticercosis, low\u2010certainty evidence suggests little to no effect of albendazole (most commonly 15 mg/kg daily) on overall seizure recurrence; however, the impact of this treatment may vary across subgroups depending on numbers and/or types of cysts. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that albendazole probably reduces seizure recurrence in people with single, non\u2010viable, and intraparenchymal cysts (138 vs 229 per 1000 people [most children]; all results on average). Reviewers reported results for people with non\u2010viable cysts and intraparenchymal cysts separately; both showed benefits of albendazole in terms of seizure recurrence (182 and 221, respectively, vs 333 per 1000 people; based on 507 and 681 participants, respectively). Moderate\u2010certainty evidence also shows that albendazole probably increases the number of people with complete radiological clearance of lesions (412 vs 337 per 1000 people) and provides benefits in terms of cyst evolution (725 vs 571 per 1000 people). Time to seizure remission, frequency of seizures, mortality, hospitalizations, and headaches were assessed in too few participants (103 to 470) to draw firm conclusions.",

The effects of albendazole on neurocysticercosis can include:\n1. Reduction of parasite load: Albendazole works by preventing the parasites from being able to absorb sugars, which are necessary for their survival. This can lead to a reduction in the number of parasites in the body and a decrease in the symptoms caused by the infection.\n2. Improved neurological symptoms: Albendazole can help to improve neurological symptoms such as seizures, headaches, and meningitis, which are common in people with neurocysticercosis.\n3. Reduction of inflammation: Albendazole can help to reduce inflammation in the brain and nervous system, which can help to alleviate symptoms such as swelling and pain.\n4. Prevention of further damage: By reducing the parasite load and inflammation, albendazole can help to prevent further damage to the brain and nervous system.\nIt's important to note that albendazole is not a cure for neurocysticercosis, and treatment may need to be combined with other medications and therapies to effectively manage the infection and its symptoms. It's also important to note that albendazole can have side effects, so it's important to discuss any concerns with a healthcare provider.",

            "llm_answer": "Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are medications commonly used to treat conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcers, and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. However, for individuals with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), PPIs can have both positive and negative effects prior to endoscopic diagnosis.\nPositive effects:\n1. Reduced bleeding: PPIs can help reduce the bleeding in the stomach and duodenum by decreasing the production of stomach acid. This can help alleviate symptoms such as hematemesis (vomiting blood) and melena (black, tarry stools).\n2. Improved visibility during endoscopy: By reducing the amount of acid in the stomach, PPIs can improve the visibility of the mucosal surface during endoscopy, allowing the healthcare provider to better assess the extent of the bleeding and identify the site of the bleed.\nNegative effects:\n1. Delayed diagnosis: PPIs can mask the symptoms of UGIB, making it difficult to diagnose the condition accurately. This can lead to a delay in treatment and potentially worsen the outcome for the patient.\n2. Increased risk of complications: PPIs can increase the risk of complications such as aspiration pneumonia, which can occur when food, liquids, or vomit enter the lungs. This is particularly concerning for patients with UGIB who may already have compromised respiratory function.\n3. Interaction with other medications: PPIs can interact with other medications, such as anticoagulants, and increase the risk of bleeding. This can be particularly dangerous for patients with UGIB who may already be at risk of bleeding.\nIn conclusion, while PPIs can help reduce bleeding and improve visibility during endoscopy, they can also delay diagnosis, increase the risk of complications, and interact with other medications. It is essential to weigh the benefits and risks of PPI use in patients with UGIB and to carefully monitor their condition before and during endoscopic diagnosis.",

Consequently, the effectiveness and safety of aural toileting remain unclear.",

            "llm_answer": "Aural toileting, also known as ear cleaning or ear irrigation, is a common practice used to remove earwax, debris, and other materials from the ear canal. However, for children with chronic suppurative otitis media, aural toileting can have some negative effects.\nChronic suppurative otitis media is a condition where the middle ear becomes chronically infected and drains pus through the ear canal. In this case, aural toileting can push the pus and infection further into the ear canal, potentially causing more damage to the ear drum and increasing the risk of hearing loss. Additionally, the use of cotton swabs or other objects to clean the ear canal can cause further irritation and push the infection deeper into the ear.\nInstead of aural toileting, it is recommended to use antibiotic ear drops to treat the infection and allow the ear to heal on its own. In some cases, a tympanostomy tube may be inserted to help drain the middle ear and alleviate the infection. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment of chronic suppurative otitis media.\nIn summary, aural toileting is not recommended for children with chronic suppurative otitis media, as it can push the infection further into the ear and potentially cause more damage to the ear drum. Instead, antibiotic ear drops and other medical interventions should be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional to treat the infection and promote healing.",

IgM antibodies, on the other hand, are detectable earlier, typically within 3-5 days after the onset of symptoms, but they decay more quickly than IgG antibodies.\nStudies have shown that IgG and IgM antibody tests can have a high sensitivity and specificity for detecting past SARS-CoV-2 infection, with sensitivity ranging from 80-100% and specificity ranging from 90-100%. However, false negatives can occur in individuals who have not yet developed antibodies or who have low levels of antibodies, and false positives can occur in individuals who have been infected with other coronaviruses or have certain medical conditions.\nIt's important to note that antibody tests are not perfect and should be interpreted in the context of other clinical and epidemiological information. A negative antibody test result does not necessarily rule out past infection, and a positive result does not necessarily confirm infection.\nIn summary, IgG and IgM antibody tests can be useful for detecting past SARS-CoV-2 infection, but their accuracy can vary depending on several factors, and they should be used in conjunction with other clinical and epidemiological information.",

Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that can help maintain a healthy gut microbiome, which is important for the development and function of various bodily systems, including the immune system.\nStudies have found that probiotics can help reduce the risk of preterm birth, which is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Probiotics have also been shown to reduce the risk of other complications in preterm infants, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious condition that can cause damage to the intestines.\nIt's important to note that not all probiotics are the same, and some strains have been found to be more effective than others in preventing morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. For example, the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any supplements during pregnancy, including probiotics, to ensure safety and effectiveness. Additionally, it's important to note that while probiotics can help reduce the risk of complications, they are not a guarantee against them, and other factors such as proper prenatal care, a healthy diet, and a safe delivery are also important for a healthy pregnancy and baby.",
