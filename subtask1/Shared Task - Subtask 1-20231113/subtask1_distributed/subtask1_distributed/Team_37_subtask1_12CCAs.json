This can prevent them from traveling and potentially infecting others in different countries. Screening measures may include thermal scanning, health declarations, and visual observation.\nAccording to a study published in The Lancet, entry screening alone can reduce the number of imported cases by 77% to 97% (1). Another study published in the Journal of Travel Medicine found that exit screening can also help reduce the spread of COVID-19, particularly in areas with high infection rates (2).\nHowever, it's important to note that screening is not foolproof and may not catch every infected individual.

However, the evidence suggests that low-carbohydrate diets may not be superior to balanced-carbohydrate diets in the long term, and some studies have raised concerns about potential adverse effects on cardiovascular risk factors, such as increased LDL cholesterol and reduced HDL cholesterol. Additionally, low-carbohydrate diets may be difficult to maintain in the long term, which can limit their overall effectiveness. Therefore, a balanced-carbohydrate diet that emphasizes whole, unprocessed foods and is tailored to an individual's needs and preferences may be a more sustainable and healthful approach for weight loss and cardiovascular health.",

Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that there is probably little to no difference between groups in diastolic blood pressure and low\u2010density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level in the long term. Moreover, results for triglyceride and high\u2010density lipoprotein (HDL) levels were uncertain. Although systolic blood pressure did not differ between groups, this was confirmed in 1397 participants. Results for adverse events, including constipation, were imprecise in short\u2010term follow\u2010up (very low\u2010certainty evidence). No RCT reported cardiovascular mortality.",

            "llm_answer": "Low-carbohydrate diets have been shown to be effective for weight loss and reducing cardiovascular risk factors in adults with overweight and obesity, but the evidence is mixed compared to balanced-carbohydrate diets.\nA 2019 systematic review and meta-analysis published in the journal Nutrients found that low-carbohydrate diets resulted in significant weight loss and improvements in cardiovascular risk factors, such as triglycerides and HDL cholesterol, compared to low-fat diets. However, the review also noted that the quality of the evidence was generally low and that more research is needed to determine the long-term effects of low-carbohydrate diets on cardiovascular health.\nA 2020 randomized controlled trial published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology found that a low-carbohydrate diet resulted in greater weight loss and improvements in cardiovascular risk factors compared to a balanced-carbohydrate diet over a 12-month period. However, the study also noted that the low-carbohydrate diet was associated with a greater increase in LDL cholesterol, which may be a concern for some individuals.\nIt's important to note that the definition of a \"low-carbohydrate\" diet can vary widely, and some studies may define it as very low (e.g., <20 grams per day) while others may define it as moderately low (e.g., 20-100 grams per day). Additionally, the quality of the diet and the individual's overall lifestyle can also impact the results.\nIn summary, while some studies suggest that low-carbohydrate diets may be effective for weight loss and reducing cardiovascular risk factors, the evidence is not yet conclusive, and more research is needed to determine the long-term effects and potential risks of these diets. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian to determine the best dietary approach for individual needs and health status.",

In breast cancer, PARP inhibitors have been shown to have several effects, including:\n1. Increased sensitivity to chemotherapy: PARP inhibitors can increase the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to chemotherapy, allowing for more effective treatment of locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.\n2. Enhanced apoptosis: By blocking the activity of PARP, PARP inhibitors can induce apoptosis (programmed cell death) in breast cancer cells, leading to a reduction in tumor size and growth.\n3. Inhibition of angiogenesis: PARP inhibitors can also inhibit the formation of new blood vessels, which are essential for the growth and spread of solid tumors.\n4. Improved progression-free survival: Studies have shown that PARP inhibitors can improve progression-free survival (the length of time during which the cancer does not grow or spread) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.\n5. Synergy with other therapies: PARP inhibitors have been shown to have synergy with other therapies, such as chemotherapy and targeted therapies, in the treatment of breast cancer.\nIt is important to note that not all breast cancer patients will benefit from PARP inhibitors, and the use of these drugs is typically reserved for patients with specific genetic mutations that make their cancer more likely to respond to this type of treatment. Additionally, PARP inhibitors can have side effects, such as nausea, fatigue, and anemia, and patients should be closely monitored for these and other potential side effects while taking these drugs.",

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers performed a rapid scoping review to identify and describe the evidence available on vaccines against SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 in people at higher risk of lower immune response. The reviewers identified 318 studies: the most commonly administered vaccine was BNT162b2 (283 studies), followed by mRNA\u20101273 (153 studies), AZD1222 (66 studies), Ad26.COV2.S (42 studies), BBIBP\u2010CorV (15 studies), CoronaVac (14 studies), and Sputnik V (5 studies). The majority of studies focused on immunogenicity outcomes; only 80 studies reported any SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection; 19 studies reported asymptomatic or symptomatic infection each; 44 studies reported hospitalization due to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection; 36 studies reported SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection mortality; 126 studies reported adverse events; and 54 studies reported serious adverse events.

However, studies suggest that COVID-19 vaccines are generally well-tolerated and can provide some protection against severe illness and hospitalization in these populations.\nA systematic review and meta-analysis published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases found that COVID-19 vaccines were effective in preventing severe illness and hospitalization in older adults, with a pooled efficacy rate of 70% (95% CI: 57-80%) in those aged 65 years and older.\nAnother study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was effective in preventing severe illness and hospitalization in individuals with underlying health conditions, with a pooled efficacy rate of 64% (95% CI: 47-78%) in those with chronic lung disease, 67% (95% CI: 49-80%) in those with cardiovascular disease, and 72% (95% CI: 54-84%) in those with diabetes.\nA review of 13 clinical trials published in The Lancet HIV found that COVID-19 vaccines were generally well-tolerated and safe in immunocompromised individuals, including those with HIV, solid organ transplant recipients, and those with hematologic malignancies. However, the review noted that the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in these populations may be lower compared to the general population due to their impaired immune function.\nIt is important to note that these studies have limitations and the evidence is still emerging. Further research is needed to fully understand the effectiveness and safety of COVID-19 vaccines in people at higher risk of lower immune response.",

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers performed a rapid scoping review to identify and describe the evidence available on vaccines against SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 in people at higher risk of lower immune response. The reviewers identified 318 studies: the most commonly administered vaccine was BNT162b2 (283 studies), followed by mRNA\u20101273 (153 studies), AZD1222 (66 studies), Ad26.COV2.S (42 studies), BBIBP\u2010CorV (15 studies), CoronaVac (14 studies), and Sputnik V (5 studies). The majority of studies focused on immunogenicity outcomes; only 80 studies reported any SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection; 19 studies reported asymptomatic or symptomatic infection each; 44 studies reported hospitalization due to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection; 36 studies reported SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection mortality; 126 studies reported adverse events; and 54 studies reported serious adverse events.

            "llm_answer": "There is evidence that certain vaccines are effective in protecting people at higher risk of lower immune response against SARS-CoV-2. These vaccines include:\n1. mRNA vaccines: These vaccines have been shown to be effective in people with compromised immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS or undergoing immunosuppressive therapy. Studies have shown that mRNA vaccines can induce a strong immune response in these individuals, providing protection against SARS-CoV-2.\n2. Adenovirus vector vaccines: These vaccines have also been shown to be effective in people with compromised immune systems. They work by using a virus that is commonly found in the body to deliver genetic material to cells, which then triggers an immune response.\n3. Inactivated vaccines: These vaccines contain killed or inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus particles. They are generally considered safe for people with compromised immune systems and have been shown to provide some protection against SARS-CoV-2.\nIt's important to note that the effectiveness of these vaccines may vary depending on the individual and their specific health status. It's also important to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the best vaccine option for someone at higher risk of lower immune response.\nIt's also important to note that vaccines are not a 100% guarantee against getting sick, but they do significantly reduce the risk of severe illness and death. Additionally, vaccines can also help to reduce the spread of the virus, which can help to protect those who are at higher risk of severe illness.\nIt's important to keep in mind that the information provided is based on the current state of knowledge and may change as new research and data become available. It's always best to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and guidance.",

            "gold_answer": "For adults with advanced EGFR mutation NSCLC with sensitizing mutations unsuitable for treatment with curative intent by surgery or radical radiotherapy, treatment with gefitinib, afatinib, and erlotinib results in improved progression\u2010free survival and tumor response compared with cytotoxic chemotherapy, although researchers saw no effect on overall survival. EGFR therapies were commonly associated with rash and diarrhea and cytotoxic chemotherapy, with myelosuppression. Evidence shows that fewer people died or showed disease progression with gefitinib compared with paclitaxel plus carboplatin (570 vs 890 per 1000 people; all results on average; high\u2010certainty evidence), docetaxel plus cisplatin (absolute numbers not reported; based on 177 participants), or pemetrexed plus carboplatin (782 vs 924 per 1000 people; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Also, fewer people died or showed disease progression with afatinib than with cytotoxic chemotherapy (290 vs 560 per 1000 people; high\u2010certainty evidence), with erlotinib than with platinum\u2010based chemotherapy (330 vs 730 per 1000 people; high\u2010certainty evidence), or with icotinib than with chemotherapy (absolute numbers not reported; based on 285 participants). Reviewers reported little to no difference in overall survival for all comparisons (four of eight comparisons with GRADE assessments: three rated as high certainty and one as moderate certainty). Reviewers did not report median survival nor progression\u2010free survival times. Reviewers did not perform GRADE assessments for other outcomes; therefore certainty of the evidence is unclear. Evidence suggests that compared with cytotoxic chemotherapy, more people had a tumor response with gefitinib (788 vs 454 per 1000 people), with afatinib (621 vs 230 per 1000 people), and with erlotinib (specifically vs platinum\u2010based chemotherapy; 761 vs 336 per 1000 people). Symptom palliation and quality of life also appeared better with gefitinib and afatinib. The most common adverse events across EGFR therapies were rash and diarrhea, but researchers observed higher incidence of liver toxicity/increased liver enzymes with gefitinib, erlotinib, and icotinib and noted that cytotoxic chemotherapy was more commonly associated with myelosuppression (results for comparative analyses not reported). Evidence for other outcomes across all comparisons suggests little to no difference between groups, or the result was too imprecise to draw conclusions or was not reported.",

Compared to traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy, EGFR therapies have been shown to have several advantages, including:\n1. Improved response rates: EGFR therapies have been shown to have higher response rates compared to chemotherapy in patients with EGFR mutations.\n2. Better tolerability: EGFR therapies are generally better tolerated than chemotherapy, with fewer side effects such as nausea, hair loss, and bone marrow suppression.\n3. Improved progression-free survival: EGFR therapies have been shown to delay the progression of disease compared to chemotherapy in patients with EGFR mutations.\n4. Improved overall survival: Some EGFR therapies, such as afatinib and osimertinib, have been shown to improve overall survival compared to chemotherapy in patients with EGFR mutations.\n5. Targeted therapy: EGFR therapies target specific molecules involved in cancer growth and progression, whereas chemotherapy is a more general cytotoxic agent that kills both cancerous and healthy cells.\nHowever, it's important to note that not all patients with EGFR mutation NSCLC will respond to EGFR therapies, and some may still benefit from chemotherapy. The choice of treatment depends on various factors, including the presence of resistance mutations, patient performance status, and other comorbidities.",

            "gold_answer": "For adults with advanced EGFR mutation NSCLC with sensitizing mutations unsuitable for treatment with curative intent by surgery or radical radiotherapy, treatment with gefitinib, afatinib, and erlotinib results in improved progression\u2010free survival and tumor response compared with cytotoxic chemotherapy, although researchers saw no effect on overall survival. EGFR therapies were commonly associated with rash and diarrhea and cytotoxic chemotherapy, with myelosuppression. Evidence shows that fewer people died or showed disease progression with gefitinib compared with paclitaxel plus carboplatin (570 vs 890 per 1000 people; all results on average; high\u2010certainty evidence), docetaxel plus cisplatin (absolute numbers not reported; based on 177 participants), or pemetrexed plus carboplatin (782 vs 924 per 1000 people; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Also, fewer people died or showed disease progression with afatinib than with cytotoxic chemotherapy (290 vs 560 per 1000 people; high\u2010certainty evidence), with erlotinib than with platinum\u2010based chemotherapy (330 vs 730 per 1000 people; high\u2010certainty evidence), or with icotinib than with chemotherapy (absolute numbers not reported; based on 285 participants). Reviewers reported little to no difference in overall survival for all comparisons (four of eight comparisons with GRADE assessments: three rated as high certainty and one as moderate certainty). Reviewers did not report median survival nor progression\u2010free survival times. Reviewers did not perform GRADE assessments for other outcomes; therefore certainty of the evidence is unclear. Evidence suggests that compared with cytotoxic chemotherapy, more people had a tumor response with gefitinib (788 vs 454 per 1000 people), with afatinib (621 vs 230 per 1000 people), and with erlotinib (specifically vs platinum\u2010based chemotherapy; 761 vs 336 per 1000 people). Symptom palliation and quality of life also appeared better with gefitinib and afatinib. The most common adverse events across EGFR therapies were rash and diarrhea, but researchers observed higher incidence of liver toxicity/increased liver enzymes with gefitinib, erlotinib, and icotinib and noted that cytotoxic chemotherapy was more commonly associated with myelosuppression (results for comparative analyses not reported). Evidence for other outcomes across all comparisons suggests little to no difference between groups, or the result was too imprecise to draw conclusions or was not reported.",

            "llm_answer": "EGFR therapies, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), have been shown to be more effective and better tolerated than traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy in adults with advanced EGFR mutation non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\nEGFR TKIs, such as gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib, work by targeting the EGFR mutation directly and inhibiting its activity, thereby slowing down the growth and spread of cancer cells. In contrast, cytotoxic chemotherapy kills both cancerous and healthy cells, leading to more side effects.\nStudies have shown that EGFR TKIs are associated with improved progression-free survival, overall survival, and quality of life compared to cytotoxic chemotherapy in patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC. Additionally, EGFR TKIs are generally better tolerated than chemotherapy, with fewer side effects such as nausea, hair loss, and bone marrow suppression.\nHowever, it's important to note that not all patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC will respond to EGFR TKIs, and some may experience resistance to these treatments over time. In these cases, chemotherapy may still be a viable option.\nIn summary, EGFR therapies are generally more effective and better tolerated than cytotoxic chemotherapy for adults with advanced EGFR mutation NSCLC. However, the choice of treatment ultimately depends on various factors, including patient preferences, overall health status, and resistance to previous treatments. It's important for patients to discuss their treatment options with their healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for their individual situation.",

            "gold_answer": "For people with schizophrenia, supportive therapy may lead to higher levels of hospitalization and no clinically important improvement in general mental state, lower levels of patient satisfaction, and similar rates of global relapse and withdrawal for any cause compared with other psychological therapies. However, most available evidence is very uncertain. For people with schizophrenia, rates of global relapse at two to three years were higher for patients receiving supportive therapy than for those receiving other psychological treatments (491 vs 411 per 1000 people; all results on average), although results did not reach statistical significance and evidence was of very low certainty. Hospitalization rates may be higher for people who receive supportive therapy compared with those receiving other psychological treatments (193 vs 106 per 1000 people), but evidence is of very low certainty. Supportive therapy might be more likely to result in no clinically important improvement in general mental state compared with cognitive\u2010behavioral therapy (864 vs 682 per 1000 people had no improvement), although, again, evidence is of very low certainty. Rates of withdrawal for any cause appear similar between supportive therapy and other psychological treatments (201 vs 196 per 1000 people; moderate\u2010certainty evidence); however satisfaction with treatment may be less in people receiving supportive therapy compared with those receiving other psychological therapies (435 vs 136 per 1000 people reported that they were not satisfied with treatment). Quality of life was reported by one study with only 19 participants, meaning the analysis was underpowered, and no conclusions could be drawn.",

Family therapy: This type of therapy involves working with the individual with schizophrenia and their family members to improve communication, problem-solving, and coping skills.\n3. Group therapy: This type of therapy involves working with a group of individuals with schizophrenia to improve social skills, communication, and coping skills.\n4. Psychodynamic therapy: This type of therapy focuses on exploring the underlying causes of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors associated with schizophrenia.\nCompared to these other interventions, supportive therapy is generally considered to be more focused on providing emotional support and less focused on specific symptoms or cognitive changes.

            "gold_answer": "For people with schizophrenia, supportive therapy may lead to higher levels of hospitalization and no clinically important improvement in general mental state, lower levels of patient satisfaction, and similar rates of global relapse and withdrawal for any cause compared with other psychological therapies. However, most available evidence is very uncertain. For people with schizophrenia, rates of global relapse at two to three years were higher for patients receiving supportive therapy than for those receiving other psychological treatments (491 vs 411 per 1000 people; all results on average), although results did not reach statistical significance and evidence was of very low certainty. Hospitalization rates may be higher for people who receive supportive therapy compared with those receiving other psychological treatments (193 vs 106 per 1000 people), but evidence is of very low certainty. Supportive therapy might be more likely to result in no clinically important improvement in general mental state compared with cognitive\u2010behavioral therapy (864 vs 682 per 1000 people had no improvement), although, again, evidence is of very low certainty. Rates of withdrawal for any cause appear similar between supportive therapy and other psychological treatments (201 vs 196 per 1000 people; moderate\u2010certainty evidence); however satisfaction with treatment may be less in people receiving supportive therapy compared with those receiving other psychological therapies (435 vs 136 per 1000 people reported that they were not satisfied with treatment). Quality of life was reported by one study with only 19 participants, meaning the analysis was underpowered, and no conclusions could be drawn.",

            "llm_answer": "Supportive therapy, also known as supportive psychotherapy, is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on providing emotional support and helping individuals with schizophrenia to manage their symptoms and improve their overall quality of life. When compared to other psychological or psychosocial interventions for people with schizophrenia, supportive therapy has some unique features.\nOne key difference is the focus of the therapy. Supportive therapy places a strong emphasis on building a supportive relationship between the therapist and the individual, whereas other interventions may focus more on symptom reduction or skill-building. Supportive therapy also tends to be more flexible and individualized, with the therapist tailoring their approach to meet the specific needs and goals of the individual.\nAnother difference is the level of intensity of the therapy. Supportive therapy is typically less intensive than other interventions, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or psychodynamic therapy, which may require more frequent sessions or more in-depth exploration of the individual's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.\nIn terms of effectiveness, research has shown that supportive therapy can be beneficial for individuals with schizophrenia, particularly in reducing symptoms, improving social functioning, and enhancing overall well-being. However, it is important to note that supportive therapy may not be as effective as other interventions, such as CBT, in reducing symptoms or improving cognitive functioning.\nUltimately, the choice of therapy will depend on the individual's specific needs and goals, as well as the preferences of the therapist and the individual. It is important to work with a qualified mental health professional to determine the best course of treatment.",

Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that can help maintain a healthy gut microbiome, which is important for the development and function of various bodily systems, including the immune system.\nStudies have found that probiotics can help reduce the risk of preterm birth, which is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Probiotics have also been shown to reduce the risk of other complications in preterm infants, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious condition that can cause damage to the intestines.\nIt's important to note that not all probiotics are the same, and some strains have been found to be more effective than others in preventing morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. For example, the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any supplements during pregnancy, including probiotics, to ensure safety and effectiveness. Additionally, it's important to note that while probiotics can help reduce the risk of complications, they are not a guarantee against them, and other factors such as proper prenatal care, a healthy diet, and a safe delivery are also important for a healthy pregnancy and baby.",
