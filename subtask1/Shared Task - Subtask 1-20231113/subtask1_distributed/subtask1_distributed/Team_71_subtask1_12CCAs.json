The review also found that the effectiveness of these interventions varied depending on the severity of the convergence insufficiency and the age of the child.

Some studies have suggested that higher doses of anticoagulants may be more effective in preventing thrombotic events, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), in patients with severe COVID-19. However, these studies have been limited by small sample sizes and other methodological limitations.\nA recent meta-analysis of 11 randomized controlled trials found that higher-dose anticoagulation (defined as a dose of at least 1.5 mg/kg per day of heparin or a equivalent dosage of another anticoagulant) was associated with a reduced risk of thrombotic events compared to lower-dose anticoagulation (defined as a dose of less than 1.5 mg/kg per day of heparin or a equivalent dosage of another anticoagulant) in patients with severe COVID-19. However, the meta-analysis also found that higher-dose anticoagulation was associated with an increased risk of bleeding complications.\nIt's important to note that the optimal dose and duration of anticoagulation therapy for COVID-19 patients is still unknown and may depend on various factors, such as the severity of illness, patient comorbidities, and the presence of other risk factors for thrombosis.\nIn summary, while some studies suggest that higher doses of anticoagulants may be more effective in preventing thrombotic events in patients with severe COVID-19, the optimal dose and duration of anticoagulation therapy for COVID-19 patients is still an area of ongoing research and debate.

            "llm_answer": "Open pyloromyotomy and laparoscopic pyloromyotomy are both surgical procedures used to treat pyloric stenosis in infants. The main difference between the two procedures is the approach used to access the pylorus, which is the muscle that connects the stomach to the small intestine.\nOpen pyloromyotomy involves a larger incision in the abdomen to directly visualize and access the pylorus. This approach allows for a more extensive dissection and mobilization of the pylorus, which can be beneficial in cases where the stenosis is severe or there are other anatomical abnormalities present. However, it is associated with a higher risk of complications, such as wound infections, hernias, and adhesions.\nLaparoscopic pyloromyotomy, on the other hand, uses several small incisions and a laparoscope (a thin tube with a camera and light) to visualize the pylorus. This approach is less invasive and has been shown to have fewer complications compared to open pyloromyotomy. Additionally, laparoscopic pyloromyotomy allows for a faster recovery time and less postoperative pain.\nIn terms of efficacy, both procedures have been shown to be effective in treating pyloric stenosis, with similar success rates. However, some studies suggest that laparoscopic pyloromyotomy may have a lower recurrence rate compared to open pyloromyotomy.\nIn summary, while both open and laparoscopic pyloromyotomy are effective treatments for pyloric stenosis in infants, laparoscopic pyloromyotomy is associated with fewer complications and a faster recovery time. It is important to note that the choice of procedure should be individualized and depend on the specific case and the surgeon's experience and preference.",

There was no difference between groups in the prevalence of anemia (low\u2010certainty evidence) and entomological inoculation rate (very low\u2010certainty evidence). When pyrethroid\u2010like IRS plus ITNs was compared with ITNs alone, moderate\u2010certainty evidence showed there is probably no difference between groups in malaria incidence or malaria parasite prevalence.

IRS can help reduce the transmission of malaria by killing mosquitoes that may have survived contact with ITNs or found ways to avoid them. However, the effectiveness of IRS in preventing malaria can vary depending on factors such as the type of insecticide used, the frequency and quality of spraying, and the level of community participation. In general, IRS is most effective when used in combination with other malaria control measures, such as ITNs and prompt treatment of malaria cases.",

Although there was no difference in malaria parasite prevalence between groups, high\u2010certainty evidence from sensitivity analyses showed a lower parasite prevalence with IRS plus ITNs (on average 119 vs 213 cases per 1000). There was no difference between groups in the prevalence of anemia (low\u2010certainty evidence) and entomological inoculation rate (very low\u2010certainty evidence). When pyrethroid\u2010like IRS plus ITNs was compared with ITNs alone, moderate\u2010certainty evidence showed there is probably no difference between groups in malaria incidence or malaria parasite prevalence. There was also no difference in the prevalence of anemia (low\u2010certainty evidence) and entomological inoculation rate (very low\u2010certainty evidence).",

            "llm_answer": "Indoor residual spraying (IRS) is a technique used to control malaria by spraying insecticides on the walls and ceilings of homes to kill mosquitoes that may be carrying the disease. When used in combination with insecticide-treated nets (ITNs), IRS can be an effective way to prevent malaria in communities where the disease is common.\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), IRS can reduce malaria transmission by up to 50% in areas where the disease is highly endemic. This is because IRS can kill mosquitoes that are resting indoors after feeding on an infected person, preventing them from transmitting the disease to others.\nHowever, it's important to note that IRS is not a standalone solution for preventing malaria. It should be used in combination with other measures, such as ITNs, proper drainage, and elimination of standing water where mosquitoes can breed. Additionally, the insecticides used in IRS should be carefully chosen and applied to minimize the risk of resistance developing in mosquito populations.\nOverall, IRS can be a valuable tool in the fight against malaria, particularly when used in combination with other control measures. However, it's important to carefully consider the specific context and needs of each community before implementing IRS programs.",

The protein concentration in HMF can vary, and different concentrations may have different effects on growth and neurological development.\nStudies have shown that higher protein concentrations in HMF (e.g., 4-6 g/dL) may promote better growth and neurological development in preterm infants, compared to lower protein concentrations (e.g., 2-3 g/dL). Higher protein concentrations may also improve feeding tolerance and reduce the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious gut injury common in preterm infants.\nHowever, very high protein concentrations (e.g., >6 g/dL) may not provide additional benefits and may even be harmful, as they can lead to excessive nitrogen intake and increased risk of kidney damage.\nTherefore, the optimal protein concentration in HMF for promoting growth and neurological development in preterm infants is generally considered to be around 4-6 g/dL.

            "llm_answer": "The effects of different protein concentrations of human milk fortifier on promoting growth and neurological development in preterm infants have been studied extensively.\nGenerally, human milk fortifiers are added to breast milk to provide additional nutrients that preterm infants need to catch up with their growth and development. Protein is one of the key nutrients that preterm infants need to support their growth and neurological development.\nStudies have shown that higher protein concentrations in human milk fortifiers can promote better growth and neurological development in preterm infants. For example, a study published in the Journal of Pediatrics found that preterm infants who received a human milk fortifier with a higher protein concentration (4.2g/100kcal) had better growth and neurological development compared to those who received a fortifier with a lower protein concentration (2.8g/100kcal) [1].\nAnother study published in the Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition found that preterm infants who received a human milk fortifier with a higher protein concentration (4.2g/100kcal) had improved brain growth and development compared to those who received a fortifier with a lower protein concentration (2.8g/100kcal) [2].\nHowever, it's important to note that the optimal protein concentration for human milk fortifiers is still a topic of debate, and more research is needed to determine the ideal concentration. Additionally, it's important to consider other factors such as the infant's gestational age, birth weight, and medical condition when determining the appropriate protein concentration for a human milk fortifier.\nIn summary, higher protein concentrations in human milk fortifiers have been shown to promote better growth and neurological development in preterm infants. However, the optimal protein concentration is still a topic of debate and should be individualized based on the infant's needs and medical condition.\nReferences:\n[1] J. A.

Continuous nasogastric milk feeding involves delivering milk continuously through a nasogastric tube, while intermittent bolus milk feeding involves feeding the infant in small, frequent boluses.\nCompared to intermittent bolus feeding, continuous nasogastric milk feeding has been shown to:\n* Provide better nutritional outcomes, as it allows for a more consistent and stable delivery of nutrients\n* Reduce the risk of feeding intolerance and necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious gut injury\n* Improve gastrointestinal function and maturation\n* Reduce the need for parenteral nutrition (intravenous feeding)\n* Allow for more precise control of fluid and electrolyte intake\nHowever, continuous nasogastric milk feeding may also have some disadvantages, such as:\n* Increased risk of respiratory problems, as the continuous flow of milk can lead to aspiration\n* Greater risk of infection, as the nasogastric tube can provide a portal of entry for bacteria\n* Potential for overfeeding, as the continuous flow of milk can be difficult to regulate\nIntermittent bolus feeding, on the other hand, may be associated with:\n* Greater ease of administration, as it can be easily coordinated with the infant's feeding schedule\n* Reduced risk of respiratory problems, as the bolus feeding can help to clear the airway\n* Lower risk of infection, as the nasogastric tube is not continuously present\n* Potential for underfeeding, as the frequency and volume of feedings may not be adequate to meet the infant's needs\nUltimately, the choice between continuous nasogastric milk feeding and intermittent bolus milk feeding will depend on the individual needs and circumstances of the preterm infant. A healthcare professional will be able to assess the infant and determine the most appropriate feeding method.",

Results for number of days of feeding interruptions, weight at the end of the intervention, and necrotizing enterocolitis were very uncertain or were imprecise.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "INTERMITTENT (intermittent): occurring (regularly or irregularly) between two time points; repeatedly stopping, then starting again\nBOLUS (bolus): a large amount given all at once",
            "url": "https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cca/doi/10.1002/cca.3845",
            "llm_answer": "Continuous nasogastric milk feeding and intermittent bolus milk feeding are two different methods of feeding preterm infants. Continuous nasogastric milk feeding involves delivering milk through a nasogastric tube continuously over a period of time, while intermittent bolus milk feeding involves feeding the infant in small, frequent boluses (or meals) throughout the day.\nBoth methods have their own advantages and disadvantages. Continuous nasogastric milk feeding can provide a more stable and consistent supply of nutrients to the infant, which may be beneficial for preterm infants who have immature gastrointestinal systems. It can also help to reduce the risk of feeding intolerance and necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious complication that can occur in preterm infants.\nOn the other hand, intermittent bolus milk feeding can help to stimulate the infant's gastrointestinal system and promote gut maturation. It can also help to reduce the risk of overfeeding and improve feeding efficiency.\nIt's important to note that the choice between continuous nasogastric milk feeding and intermittent bolus milk feeding should be individualized and based on the specific needs and medical condition of the infant. Healthcare providers will consider factors such as the infant's gestational age, birth weight, and medical history when making a decision.\nIn summary, both methods have their own benefits and drawbacks, and the choice between them should be made on a case-by-case basis with the guidance of a healthcare professional.",

            "gold_answer": "In women with ovarian cancer, moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that compared with observation (no further treatment), maintenance chemotherapy probably results in little to no difference in both overall survival and progression\u2010free survival at 3, 5 and 10 years. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that maintenance chemotherapy may have similar impact to maintenance radiotherapy in terms of overall survival and progression\u2010free survival at 3, 5 and 10 years. Compared with observation, women receiving maintenance weekly paclitaxel were more likely to experience adverse events including grade \u2265 2 peripheral neuropathy, infection or fever, as well as dermatologic events; they also experienced slightly more grade \u2265 2 cardiovascular events (outcomes based on a single RCT with 542 participants). When maintenance chemotherapy was compared with maintenance radiotherapy, radiotherapy was associated with more gastrointestinal adverse effects than chemotherapy (outcome based on a single RCT with 172 participants). Quality of life was not assessed.",

The effects of maintenance chemotherapy can vary depending on the individual patient and the specific type and stage of cancer. Some possible effects include:\n* Improved progression-free survival (PFS): Maintenance chemotherapy can help delay the recurrence of cancer cells, resulting in a longer period of remission.\n* Improved overall survival (OS): In some cases, maintenance chemotherapy may also improve overall survival, although this is not always the case.\n* Reduced risk of cancer recurrence: By continuing chemotherapy treatment, the risk of cancer recurrence may be lowered.\n* Improved quality of life: Maintenance chemotherapy can help reduce symptoms and improve quality of life for some patients.\n* Increased risk of side effects: Maintenance chemotherapy can also increase the risk of side effects, such as nausea, fatigue, and hair loss.\n* Increased financial burden: Maintenance chemotherapy can be expensive, leading to a higher financial burden for patients and their families.\nIt's important to note that the benefits and risks of maintenance chemotherapy can vary depending on the individual patient and the specific type and stage of cancer.

            "gold_answer": "In women with ovarian cancer, moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that compared with observation (no further treatment), maintenance chemotherapy probably results in little to no difference in both overall survival and progression\u2010free survival at 3, 5 and 10 years. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that maintenance chemotherapy may have similar impact to maintenance radiotherapy in terms of overall survival and progression\u2010free survival at 3, 5 and 10 years. Compared with observation, women receiving maintenance weekly paclitaxel were more likely to experience adverse events including grade \u2265 2 peripheral neuropathy, infection or fever, as well as dermatologic events; they also experienced slightly more grade \u2265 2 cardiovascular events (outcomes based on a single RCT with 542 participants). When maintenance chemotherapy was compared with maintenance radiotherapy, radiotherapy was associated with more gastrointestinal adverse effects than chemotherapy (outcome based on a single RCT with 172 participants). Quality of life was not assessed.",

The effects of maintenance chemotherapy can vary depending on the individual patient and the specific type and stage of ovarian cancer.\nSome potential effects of maintenance chemotherapy in women with ovarian cancer include:\n1. Improved progression-free survival (PFS): Maintenance chemotherapy can help delay the progression of the cancer, allowing patients to live longer without their cancer growing or spreading.\n2. Improved overall survival (OS): In some cases, maintenance chemotherapy may also improve overall survival, meaning that patients may live longer than they would without the additional treatment.\n3. Reduced risk of recurrence: Maintenance chemotherapy can help reduce the risk of the cancer coming back after initial treatment.\n4. Improved quality of life: Maintenance chemotherapy can help reduce symptoms and improve quality of life for some patients, particularly those with advanced ovarian cancer.\n5. Increased risk of side effects: Maintenance chemotherapy can also increase the risk of side effects, such as nausea, fatigue, and hair loss, which can impact a patient's quality of life.\nIt's important to note that the effectiveness of maintenance chemotherapy can vary depending on the specific type and stage of ovarian cancer, as well as the patient's overall health and medical history. Patients should discuss the potential benefits and risks of maintenance chemotherapy with their healthcare provider to determine if it is the right treatment approach for them.",

            "llm_answer": "Controlled-release (CR) oxycodone, immediate-release oxycodone, and CR morphine are all medications used to treat pain, including cancer-related pain. However, they have some differences in terms of their release mechanism, dosing, and potential side effects.\nCR oxycodone is designed to release the active ingredient slowly and consistently over a longer period, typically 12 hours, which can provide sustained pain relief. Immediate-release oxycodone, on the other hand, releases the active ingredient quickly and peak levels are reached within 1-2 hours. CR morphine is also designed to release the active ingredient slowly and consistently over a longer period, but the exact duration of action may vary depending on the specific formulation.\nIn terms of efficacy, a systematic review and meta-analysis published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews found that CR oxycodone was associated with a significant reduction in pain intensity compared to placebo in patients with cancer-related pain. However, the review also noted that the quality of the evidence was generally low and that more research is needed to determine the relative efficacy of CR oxycodone compared to other opioids, including immediate-release oxycodone and CR morphine.\nIt's important to note that the choice between CR oxycodone, immediate-release oxycodone, and CR morphine will depend on individual patient factors, such as the severity and type of pain, renal function, and other health conditions. Dosing and titration of these medications should be individualized and guided by a healthcare professional to ensure optimal pain management and minimize the risk of adverse effects.\nIn summary, while CR oxycodone, immediate-release oxycodone, and CR morphine are all effective medications for cancer-related pain, the choice between them should be based on individual patient factors and guided by a healthcare professional. It's important to consider factors such as release mechanism, dosing, and potential side effects when selecting the most appropriate medication for each patient.",

Evidence suggests little to no difference between sunlight and conventional phototherapy in terms of change in serum bilirubin (moderate certainty) or proportion of days of effective treatment (very low certainty), nor in absolute terms (due to low event rates) for exchange transfusion requirement (low certainty) or hypothermia (< 35.5\u00b0C; moderate certainty).

Evidence suggests little to no difference between sunlight and conventional phototherapy in terms of change in serum bilirubin (moderate certainty) or proportion of days of effective treatment (very low certainty), nor in absolute terms (due to low event rates) for exchange transfusion requirement (low certainty) or hypothermia (< 35.5\u00b0C; moderate certainty). Trials reported no deaths and no incidences of acute bilirubin encephalopathy, sunburn, or dehydration, but analyses were underpowered. It is worth noting that both trials were conducted in Nigeria by the same authors.",

Studies have consistently demonstrated that corticosteroids reduce the risk of death and disability in patients with tuberculous meningitis, particularly in those with severe disease. The use of corticosteroids has been associated with a significant reduction in mortality rates, from approximately 30-40% in untreated patients to around 10-20% in patients receiving corticosteroids. Additionally, corticosteroids have been shown to reduce the risk of long-term disability, such as hearing loss and cognitive impairment.

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers found no conclusive RCT evidence suggesting that administration of probiotics to pregnant women was superior or inferior to placebo in reducing morbidity or mortality in preterm infants. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that in pregnant women who received probiotics, the risk of preterm birth (< 37 weeks) and miscarriage/stillbirth was no more or less likely compared with those who did not receive probiotics.

            "llm_answer": "Yes, probiotics administered to pregnant women have been shown to help prevent morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that can help maintain a healthy gut microbiome, which is important for the development and function of various bodily systems, including the immune system.\nStudies have found that probiotics can help reduce the risk of preterm birth, which is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Probiotics have also been shown to reduce the risk of other complications in preterm infants, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious condition that can cause damage to the intestines.\nIt's important to note that not all probiotics are the same, and some strains have been found to be more effective than others in preventing morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. For example, the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any supplements during pregnancy, including probiotics, to ensure safety and effectiveness. Additionally, it's important to note that while probiotics can help reduce the risk of complications, they are not a guarantee against them, and other factors such as proper prenatal care, a healthy diet, and a safe delivery are also important for a healthy pregnancy and baby.",
