            "gold_answer": "For people undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that the pain intensity may be lower (by 0.7 to 1.0 points on a 1\u201010 scale) both at 4 to 8 and 9 to 24 hours after surgery in people who received intraperitoneal instillation of local anesthetic, compared with those receiving no instillation. The instillation was most commonly performed at the end of the surgical procedure. Fewer people may experience nausea (174 vs 250 per 1000 people; based on 926 participants; all results on average) and vomiting (93 vs 140 per 1000 people; based on 1217 participants) with intraperitoneal local anesthetic instillation than with no local anesthetic. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that the mean hospital stay was probably 0.1 days shorter after intraperitoneal local anesthetic instillation, but the clinical significance of such a small difference remains unclear. The effects of intraperitoneal local anesthetic instillation were very uncertain for the outcomes of mortality, same\u2010day discharge from the hospital, serious adverse events, and non\u2010significant adverse events.",

Reduced postoperative pain: Instilling local anesthetic into the peritoneal cavity can help to reduce the pain associated with the surgery, resulting in less discomfort and improved pain management.\n2. Improved respiratory function: By reducing pain and discomfort, patients are able to breathe more easily and deeply, which can help to improve respiratory function and reduce the risk of respiratory complications.\n3. Shorter hospital stay: With reduced pain and discomfort, patients are often able to recover more quickly and may be able to leave the hospital sooner.\n4. Reduced nausea and vomiting: Local anesthetic instillation can help to reduce nausea and vomiting, which are common side effects of laparoscopic surgery.\n5. Improved patient satisfaction: By reducing pain and discomfort, patients are generally more satisfied with their surgical experience and may be more likely to choose laparoscopic surgery in the future.\nIt is important to note that the use of intraperitoneal local anesthetic instillation is not suitable for all patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and the decision to use this technique should be made on a case-by-case basis with the guidance of a qualified medical professional.",

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers conducted an overview of Cochrane Reviews and network meta\u2010analysis to answer this question. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that antifibrinolytics probably reduce menstrual blood loss (MBL) (by 80 mL/cycle, all results on average). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that levonorgestrel intrauterine device (LNG\u2010IUS) may result in a large reduction of MBL (by 106 mL/cycle), and long\u2010cycle progestogen may reduce MBL (by 77 mL/cycle). The effect of the remaining interventions on MBL is uncertain. The effect of any intervention as a first\u2010line treatment on women's perception of improvement is very uncertain. Regarding adverse events, the best treatment was placebo, followed by antifibrinolytics, non\u2010steroidal anti\u2010inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and LNG\u2010IUS. The worst treatments were luteal progestogens, combined oral contraceptive, and long\u2010cycle progestogens.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "PROGESTOGEN (progestogen): A synthetic hormone, similar to progesterone. It thickens the mucus around the cervix, making it difficult for sperm to get into the womb or for a fertilised egg to implant in the womb.\nPLACEBO (placebo): an inactive substance; a pill/liquid that contains no medicine\nCONTRACEPTION (contraception): Contraception, or birth control, is what you and your partner can use to help prevent an unwanted pregnancy or to space out your pregnancies. There are many different forms of contraception  including condoms, hormonal pills and implants, hormonal and non-hormonal coils and permanent methods such as female sterilization or vasectomy. You can get more information about contraception from your GP or a family planning clinic.",

            "llm_answer": "Medical treatments for heavy menstrual bleeding in women can have several effects, including:\n1. Reduced bleeding: Hormonal medications, such as oral contraceptives, progestins, and gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, can help reduce menstrual bleeding.\n2. Regulated cycles: Hormonal treatments can also help regulate menstrual cycles, making them more predictable and manageable.\n3. Reduced anemia: Treatments can help reduce the risk of anemia, a common complication of heavy menstrual bleeding, by increasing red blood cell production.\n4. Improved quality of life: Effective treatment can improve a woman's overall quality of life, reducing discomfort, pain, and inconvenience associated with heavy menstrual bleeding.\n5. Increased fertility: In some cases, medical treatments can improve fertility in women with heavy menstrual bleeding who may have been experiencing difficulty conceiving due to ovulation irregularities.\n6. Potential side effects: Some medical treatments may have potential side effects, such as weight gain, mood changes, or changes in sexual function, which should be discussed with a healthcare provider.\n7. Surgical intervention: In some cases, surgical intervention may be necessary, such as endometrial ablation or hysterectomy, which can be effective in reducing or eliminating menstrual bleeding.\nIt's important to note that the most appropriate treatment will depend on the underlying cause of the heavy menstrual bleeding, the severity of the condition, and the individual woman's overall health and medical history. A healthcare provider can help determine the best course of treatment for each woman.",

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers conducted an overview of Cochrane Reviews and network meta\u2010analysis to answer this question. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that antifibrinolytics probably reduce menstrual blood loss (MBL) (by 80 mL/cycle, all results on average). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that levonorgestrel intrauterine device (LNG\u2010IUS) may result in a large reduction of MBL (by 106 mL/cycle), and long\u2010cycle progestogen may reduce MBL (by 77 mL/cycle). The effect of the remaining interventions on MBL is uncertain. The effect of any intervention as a first\u2010line treatment on women's perception of improvement is very uncertain. Regarding adverse events, the best treatment was placebo, followed by antifibrinolytics, non\u2010steroidal anti\u2010inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and LNG\u2010IUS. The worst treatments were luteal progestogens, combined oral contraceptive, and long\u2010cycle progestogens.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "PROGESTOGEN (progestogen): A synthetic hormone, similar to progesterone. It thickens the mucus around the cervix, making it difficult for sperm to get into the womb or for a fertilised egg to implant in the womb.\nPLACEBO (placebo): an inactive substance; a pill/liquid that contains no medicine\nCONTRACEPTION (contraception): Contraception, or birth control, is what you and your partner can use to help prevent an unwanted pregnancy or to space out your pregnancies. There are many different forms of contraception  including condoms, hormonal pills and implants, hormonal and non-hormonal coils and permanent methods such as female sterilization or vasectomy. You can get more information about contraception from your GP or a family planning clinic.",

Some common medical treatments for heavy menstrual bleeding include:\n1. Hormonal birth control: Hormonal birth control methods such as the pill, patch, or ring can help regulate menstrual cycles and reduce bleeding.\n2. Intrauterine devices (IUDs): IUDs that release hormones, such as Mirena, can help reduce menstrual bleeding.\n3. Injectable contraceptives: Injectable contraceptives, such as Depo-Provera, can help reduce menstrual bleeding.\n4. Oral contraceptives: Oral contraceptives, such as the pill, can help regulate menstrual cycles and reduce bleeding.\n5. Progestins: Progestins, such as norethindrone, can help reduce menstrual bleeding.\n6. Anti-inflammatory medications: Anti-inflammatory medications, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, can help reduce cramping and pain associated with heavy menstrual bleeding.\n7. Blood transfusions: In severe cases of heavy menstrual bleeding, blood transfusions may be necessary to replace lost blood.\n8. Surgery: In some cases, surgery may be necessary to treat the underlying cause of heavy menstrual bleeding, such as fibroids, polyps, or endometriosis.\nThe effects of these treatments can vary depending on the individual woman and the severity of her heavy menstrual bleeding. Some common side effects of these treatments include:\n* Hormonal changes: Hormonal birth control and progestins can cause changes in mood, weight, and breast tenderness.\n* Cramping and spotting: Hormonal birth control and IUDs can cause cramping and spotting.\n* Nausea and vomiting: Injectable contraceptives and oral contraceptives can cause nausea and vomiting.\n* Headaches: Hormonal birth control and progestins can cause headaches.\n* Mood changes: Hormonal birth control and",

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers identified four nutritional standard interventions aimed at decreasing consumption/sales of sugar\u2010sweetened beverages in schools: reducing availability of these beverages; improving access to drinking water; giving small prizes (such as bracelets, pens, fancy pencils, notebooks, or toys) for selecting healthier beverages; and improving placement of healthier beverages in cafeterias. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that giving small prizes probably reduces the number of meals per week for which children select unhealthy beverages. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that reduced availability of sugar\u2010sweetened beverages in schools may reduce consumption but improved placement of healthier beverages in cafeterias may not. The certainty of evidence for improving access to drinking water was rated as very low.",

Studies have shown that schools that implement nutritional standards, such as the USDA's Smart Snacks in Schools program, have seen a reduction in the sales of sugar-sweetened beverages and an increase in the sales of water and other low-calorie drinks. Additionally, research has found that students who attend schools with stricter nutritional standards tend to have lower consumption of added sugars and higher consumption of fruits and vegetables. Overall, implementing nutritional standards in schools can be an effective strategy for promoting healthier beverage choices and reducing childhood obesity.",

Many schools have implemented policies that limit or prohibit the sale of sugary drinks in vending machines and cafeterias, instead offering healthier options such as water, low-fat milk, and 100% fruit juice. This shift towards healthier options has led to a decrease in the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages among students.\nAccording to a study published in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, the implementation of nutritional standards in schools led to a 37% reduction in the sales of sugary drinks. Additionally, a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that students in schools with strong nutritional standards consumed 26% fewer calories from sugary drinks compared to students in schools with weaker standards.\nThe impact of nutritional standards on the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages in schools has been positive, as it has helped to reduce the intake of added sugars among children and adolescents. Excessive consumption of added sugars has been linked to various health problems, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and dental cavities.

Moderate\u2010certainty evidence showed that antibiotic prophylaxis probably reduced specific types of infection (urinary tract by 42 and 63 per 1000 women, pelvic by 43 and 18 per 1000 women, and abdominal by 25 per 1000 women undergoing abdominal hysterectomy), incidence of postoperative fever (by 80 and 79 per 1000 women), the need for therapeutic antibiotics (by 55 and 69 per 1000 women), and duration of hospital stay (by approx. 1.4 days and 0.6 days). Evidence for adverse effects was available only for women undergoing abdominal hysterectomy and was rated by reviewers as very low certainty.

            "gold_answer": "In November 2016, reviewers identified 23 RCTs published between 1973 and 2002 that evaluated the impact of antibiotic prophylaxis for women undergoing elective vaginal or abdominal hysterectomy. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggested that antibiotic prophylaxis probably reduced the number of women contracting any postoperative infection (by 433 and 241 per 1000 women; all results average reductions for vaginal and abdominal hysterectomy, respectively). Moderate\u2010certainty evidence showed that antibiotic prophylaxis probably reduced specific types of infection (urinary tract by 42 and 63 per 1000 women, pelvic by 43 and 18 per 1000 women, and abdominal by 25 per 1000 women undergoing abdominal hysterectomy), incidence of postoperative fever (by 80 and 79 per 1000 women), the need for therapeutic antibiotics (by 55 and 69 per 1000 women), and duration of hospital stay (by approx. 1.4 days and 0.6 days). Evidence for adverse effects was available only for women undergoing abdominal hysterectomy and was rated by reviewers as very low certainty. Reviewers highlight that given the dates that RCTs were conducted, they may not reflect current practice in perioperative and postoperative care and/or may not show locoregional antimicrobial resistance patterns.",

However, it is important to note that palivizumab is not effective in preventing mild or moderate RSV infections, and it is not recommended for infants who are not at high risk for severe RSV infection.",

            "gold_answer": "For infants (mostly at high risk of RSV owing to prematurity or comorbidities) and compared with placebo or no intervention, high\u2010certainty evidence shows that use of palivizumab (15 mg/kg intramuscularly every month for up to five months) results in fewer infants hospitalized due to RSV infection (43 vs 97 per 1000 infants; all results on average) and fewer wheezing days (18 vs 45 per 1000 days). Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that palivizumab probably: leads to reduced hospitalization due to respiratory\u2010related illness (171 vs 220 per 1000 infants); has no clear impact on mortality; and does not increase adverse events. Fewer infants seem to have RSV with palivizumab than with placebo or no intervention (47 vs 140 per 1000 infants), although the certainty of evidence is low. Results for length of hospital or intensive care unit stay were imprecise.",

High\u2010certainty evidence shows that convalescent plasma had little to no impact on mortality within 28 days, clinical worsening (need for invasive mechanical ventilation or death), or clinical improvement (number of participants discharged). There were similar rates of serious adverse events and grade 3 to 4 events in both groups, based on moderate\u2010 to low\u2010certainty evidence. Low\u2010certainty evidence also suggests no impact of convalescent plasma on quality of life.",

However, I can provide some general information on the topic.\nBronchiectasis is a chronic respiratory condition characterized by widening and thickening of the airways, which can lead to recurrent infections and inflammation. Intermittent prophylactic antibiotics are often used to prevent exacerbations in patients with bronchiectasis.\nThere have been some studies that have compared the effectiveness of 14-day and 28-day intermittent prophylactic antibiotic regimens in adults with bronchiectasis. However, it's important to note that the optimal duration of antibiotic prophylaxis for bronchiectasis is not well established, and the choice of regimen should be individualized based on patient factors and the severity of their disease.\nOne study published in the Journal of Clinical Tuberculosis and Other Mycobacterial Diseases found that both 14-day and 28-day antibiotic regimens were effective in reducing the frequency of exacerbations in patients with bronchiectasis, but the 28-day regimen may provide a longer duration of protection against exacerbations. However, the study had a small sample size and further research is needed to confirm these findings.\nAnother study published in the European Respiratory Journal found that a 28-day antibiotic regimen was associated with a lower risk of exacerbations and improved quality of life compared to a 14-day regimen in patients with severe bronchiectasis.\nIt's important to note that antibiotic duration and frequency should be tailored to the individual patient based on factors such as age, comorbidities, and disease severity. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the most appropriate treatment regimen for each patient.\nIn summary, while there is some evidence to suggest that a 28-day intermittent prophylactic antibiotic regimen may be more effective than a 14-day regimen in reducing exacerbations in adults with bronchie",

In six RCTs with 211 participants, the proportion of infants who required rescue medical treatment appeared to be lower among those who received indomethacin versus those who received placebo (139 vs 396 per 1000 infants). However, due in part to underpowered analyses, there were no clear differences between groups in all other outcomes assessed, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia (measured either at 28 days of life or at 36 weeks' gestation; low\u2010certainty evidence), all\u2010cause mortality before discharge (moderate\u2010certainty evidence), and proportion of infants requiring surgical PDA ligation (moderate\u2010certainty evidence). There were also no differences between groups in necrotizing enterocolitis (\u2265 Bell stage 2) (low\u2010certainty evidence) and mucocutaneous or gastrointestinal bleeding (low\u2010certainty evidence). The reviewers found no RCTs assessing oliguria.",

The benefits of using indomethacin for this purpose include:\n* Effective closure of the PDA: Indomethacin has been shown to effectively close the ductus arteriosus in up to 80% of infants with symptomatic PDA.\n* Reduced need for surgery: Indomethacin can help avoid surgical ligation of the PDA, which can be associated with risks and complications.\n* Improved respiratory status: Indomethacin can help improve respiratory status in infants with PDA, which can lead to better oxygenation and reduced risk of respiratory failure.\nHowever, there are also potential harms associated with the use of indomethacin for this condition, including:\n* Gastrointestinal side effects: Indomethacin can cause gastrointestinal side effects such as diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.\n* Renal impairment: Indomethacin can reduce renal blood flow and increase the risk of renal impairment, particularly in premature infants.\n* Increased risk of bleeding: Indomethacin can increase the risk of bleeding, particularly in infants with pre-existing bleeding disorders or those taking other medications that can increase the risk of bleeding.\n* Uncertain long-term effects: The long-term effects of indomethacin use in infants are not well understood, and there is concern about potential adverse effects on the developing brain and other organs.\nOverall, the benefits and harms of indomethacin for treating symptomatic PDA in infants must be carefully weighed on a case-by-case basis, and the decision to use the drug should be made by a qualified healthcare professional.",

In six RCTs with 211 participants, the proportion of infants who required rescue medical treatment appeared to be lower among those who received indomethacin versus those who received placebo (139 vs 396 per 1000 infants). However, due in part to underpowered analyses, there were no clear differences between groups in all other outcomes assessed, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia (measured either at 28 days of life or at 36 weeks' gestation; low\u2010certainty evidence), all\u2010cause mortality before discharge (moderate\u2010certainty evidence), and proportion of infants requiring surgical PDA ligation (moderate\u2010certainty evidence). There were also no differences between groups in necrotizing enterocolitis (\u2265 Bell stage 2) (low\u2010certainty evidence) and mucocutaneous or gastrointestinal bleeding (low\u2010certainty evidence).

            "gold_answer": "For women with heavy menstrual bleeding, moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that endometrial resection/ablation compared with minimally invasive hysterectomy probably results in more women requiring further surgery within one year (on average, 50 vs 6 per 1000 women) and in fewer women feeling satisfied at one year (on average, 871 vs 971 per 1000 women). Serious adverse events included re\u2010admission, cardiorespiratory events, and thromboembolic events; the pooled estimate was imprecise. The effect of endometrial resection/ablation compared with minimally invasive hysterectomy on intraoperative and immediate postoperative adverse events is uncertain.",

            "llm_answer": "Endometrial resection/ablation and minimally invasive hysterectomy are both surgical procedures used to treat heavy menstrual bleeding in women. While both procedures have been shown to be effective in reducing menstrual bleeding, they have some differences in terms of re-surgery, satisfaction with treatment, and adverse events.\nRe-surgery:\n* Endometrial resection/ablation has a higher rate of re-surgery compared to minimally invasive hysterectomy. According to a study published in the Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology, the re-surgery rate for endometrial resection/ablation was 14.1%, while the re-surgery rate for minimally invasive hysterectomy was 4.2%.\nSatisfaction with treatment:\n* Both procedures have been shown to have high satisfaction rates among patients. A study published in the Journal of Women's Health found that 88.9% of patients who underwent endometrial resection/ablation reported being satisfied with their treatment, while a study published in the Journal of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists found that 93.6% of patients who underwent minimally invasive hysterectomy reported being satisfied with their treatment.\nAdverse events:\n* Both procedures have been associated with some adverse events, although the rates vary. According to a study published in the Journal of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the most common adverse events associated with endometrial resection/ablation were bleeding (11.1%), infection (4.2%), and infertility (3.7%). The most common adverse events associated with minimally invasive hysterectomy were bleeding (6.4%), infection (3.4%), and bowel injury (2.1%).\nIt's important to note that these are general trends and that individual experiences may vary. The best way to determine the most appropriate treatment for a patient's specific case is to consult with a healthcare provider, who can assess the patient's individual needs and medical history.",

Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that can help maintain a healthy gut microbiome, which is important for the development and function of various bodily systems, including the immune system.\nStudies have found that probiotics can help reduce the risk of preterm birth, which is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Probiotics have also been shown to reduce the risk of other complications in preterm infants, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious condition that can cause damage to the intestines.\nIt's important to note that not all probiotics are the same, and some strains have been found to be more effective than others in preventing morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. For example, the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any supplements during pregnancy, including probiotics, to ensure safety and effectiveness. Additionally, it's important to note that while probiotics can help reduce the risk of complications, they are not a guarantee against them, and other factors such as proper prenatal care, a healthy diet, and a safe delivery are also important for a healthy pregnancy and baby.",
