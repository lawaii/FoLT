            "gold_answer": "For people undergoing elective surgery, melatonin may reduce preoperative and postoperative anxiety compared with placebo and may be as effective as midazolam. Melatonin (3 to 10 mg or 0.05 to 0.4 mg/kg, 50 to 120 minutes preoperatively) is probably more effective than placebo in reducing preoperative anxiety (50 to 100 minutes after premedication by approx. 12 points on a 100\u2010point scale; moderate\u2010certainty evidence) and may also reduce anxiety postoperatively (immediately after and at 6 hours by approx. 5 points on a 100\u2010point scale or State\u2010Trait Anxiety Inventory, respectively; low\u2010certainty evidence). Melatonin (3 to 6 mg or 0.05 to 0.4 mg/kg, 60 to 120 minutes preoperatively) and midazolam (1 to 15 mg or 0.05 to 0.2 mg/kg, or alprazolam 0.25 to 0.5 mg, 60 to 100 minutes preoperatively) appear equally effective in reducing anxiety preoperatively (at 50 to 100 minutes after premedication; moderate\u2010certainty evidence) and postoperatively (at 90 minutes; low\u2010certainty evidence).",

Studies have consistently found that melatonin supplementation significantly reduces anxiety levels in patients undergoing surgery, both before and after the procedure. Additionally, melatonin has been found to improve sleep quality and reduce the use of benzodiazepines, which are commonly used to treat anxiety but can have negative side effects. Overall, melatonin is a safe and effective alternative for managing anxiety in adults undergoing surgery.",

It's recommended to consult with a healthcare professional before taking melatonin supplements, especially if you have any pre-existing medical conditions or are taking any medications.\nIn addition to melatonin, other strategies that may help manage preoperative and postoperative anxiety include relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and guided imagery, as well as cognitive-behavioral therapy and mindfulness-based interventions.

Another study published in the European Heart Journal found that B-mode US guidance reduced the risk of radial artery occlusion and bleeding complications compared to the control group.\nHowever, it is important to note that B-mode US guidance may not always be necessary for every patient undergoing radial artery catheterization, and the decision to use US guidance should be made on a case-by-case basis.

            "gold_answer": "Moderate\u2010 to high\u2010certainty evidence shows that lumacaftor\u2010ivacaftor slightly improves the lung function and quality of life of adolescents and adults with cystic fibrosis homozygous for F508del and probably increases time to first pulmonary exacerbation. Infective pulmonary exacerbations may be reduced. Researchers described early transient shortness of breath in some patients and longer\u2010term increases in blood pressure with lumacaftor\u2010ivacaftor. Compared with placebo in adolescents and adults with cystic fibrosis homozygous for F508del , moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that lumacaftor (600 mg daily or 400 mg twice daily) plus ivacaftor (250 mg twice daily) for six months probably increases time to first pulmonary exacerbation; however, researchers did not report median times to exacerbation, making it difficult to quantify the benefit. Moderate\u2010 to high\u2010certainty evidence shows that lumacaftor\u2010ivacaftor improves lung function (forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV 1 ] by 5.21% predicted; all results on average) and slightly improves scores for two of the three quality of life scales used. High\u2010certainty evidence shows little to no effect of lumacaftor\u2010ivacaftor on overall adverse events, but fewer people had a serious adverse event (215 vs 306 per 1000 people). When researchers assessed individual adverse events, they found that lumacaftor\u2010ivacaftor reduced the incidence of infective pulmonary exacerbation (391 vs 511 per 1000 people), cough (340 vs 441 per 1000 people), and nasal congestion (66 vs 102 per 1000 people), but increased the incidence of dyspnea (143 vs 81 per 1000 people; commonly transient at the start of treatment). Few people discontinued treatment due to adverse events (< 3% in both groups). Seven participants (~ 1%) discontinued treatment due to elevated liver enzymes: one due to hepatitis E infection and six temporarily. Researchers reported no deaths among 1108 participants. Researchers compared lumacaftor (200 mg twice daily) plus ivacaftor (250 mg twice daily) for six months versus placebo in 204 children with cystic fibrosis. Due to the smaller numbers involved in this study, the benefits and harms of lumacaftor\u2010ivacaftor in children are less certain, but treatment was associated with benefit in FEV 1 of 2.4% predicted. A CCA reporting results for tezacaftor plus ivacaftor is available here .",

In clinical trials, treatment with Orkambi has been shown to:\n* Improve lung function by an average of 2.6% to 4.3% compared to placebo\n* Reduce the number of pulmonary exacerbations by 30% to 50% compared to placebo\n* Improve symptoms such as cough and shortness of breath\n* Slow the progression of lung disease as measured by imaging tests\nIt's important to note that Orkambi is only effective for people with cystic fibrosis who have specific genetic mutations, and it is not effective for all people with cystic fibrosis. Additionally, Orkambi can have side effects, including respiratory problems, digestive issues, and increased risk of respiratory infections. It's important for people with cystic fibrosis to work closely with their healthcare provider to determine if Orkambi is appropriate for them and to monitor their response to treatment.",

            "gold_answer": "Moderate\u2010 to high\u2010certainty evidence shows that lumacaftor\u2010ivacaftor slightly improves the lung function and quality of life of adolescents and adults with cystic fibrosis homozygous for F508del and probably increases time to first pulmonary exacerbation. Infective pulmonary exacerbations may be reduced. Researchers described early transient shortness of breath in some patients and longer\u2010term increases in blood pressure with lumacaftor\u2010ivacaftor. Compared with placebo in adolescents and adults with cystic fibrosis homozygous for F508del , moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that lumacaftor (600 mg daily or 400 mg twice daily) plus ivacaftor (250 mg twice daily) for six months probably increases time to first pulmonary exacerbation; however, researchers did not report median times to exacerbation, making it difficult to quantify the benefit. Moderate\u2010 to high\u2010certainty evidence shows that lumacaftor\u2010ivacaftor improves lung function (forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV 1 ] by 5.21% predicted; all results on average) and slightly improves scores for two of the three quality of life scales used. High\u2010certainty evidence shows little to no effect of lumacaftor\u2010ivacaftor on overall adverse events, but fewer people had a serious adverse event (215 vs 306 per 1000 people). When researchers assessed individual adverse events, they found that lumacaftor\u2010ivacaftor reduced the incidence of infective pulmonary exacerbation (391 vs 511 per 1000 people), cough (340 vs 441 per 1000 people), and nasal congestion (66 vs 102 per 1000 people), but increased the incidence of dyspnea (143 vs 81 per 1000 people; commonly transient at the start of treatment). Few people discontinued treatment due to adverse events (< 3% in both groups). Seven participants (~ 1%) discontinued treatment due to elevated liver enzymes: one due to hepatitis E infection and six temporarily. Researchers reported no deaths among 1108 participants. Researchers compared lumacaftor (200 mg twice daily) plus ivacaftor (250 mg twice daily) for six months versus placebo in 204 children with cystic fibrosis. Due to the smaller numbers involved in this study, the benefits and harms of lumacaftor\u2010ivacaftor in children are less certain, but treatment was associated with benefit in FEV 1 of 2.4% predicted. A CCA reporting results for tezacaftor plus ivacaftor is available here .",

The effects of this treatment can vary depending on the individual, but some common benefits include:\n1. Improved lung function: Studies have shown that lumacaftor plus ivacaftor can help improve lung function in people with CF, as measured by the amount of lung function decline over time.\n2. Reduced lung infections: The combination therapy has been shown to reduce the frequency and severity of lung infections, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in people with CF.\n3. Improved nutrition: Lumacaftor plus ivacaftor can help improve nutritional status by increasing body weight and body mass index (BMI) in people with CF.\n4. Reduced hospitalizations: Treatment with lumacaftor plus ivacaftor has been associated with a reduction in hospitalizations due to lung infections and other CF-related complications.\n5. Improved quality of life: Some people with CF who have received lumacaftor plus ivacaftor have reported improved quality of life, including better breathing and increased energy levels.\nIt's important to note that lumacaftor plus ivacaftor is not a cure for CF, and it may not be effective for everyone with the disease. Additionally, the medication can have side effects, such as respiratory problems, headache, and fatigue. It's important for individuals with CF to work closely with their healthcare provider to determine the best treatment plan for their specific needs.",

Outcomes were assessed using a well\u2010validated pain scale, the Premature Infant Pain Profile. The reviewers found little to no difference between groups in duration of ventilation, mortality, length of hospitalization, necrotizing enterocolitis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular hemorrhage, and periventricular leukomalacia. In addition, no conclusions can be drawn in terms of neurodevelopmental disability during early childhood. Opioid\u2010related adverse events were not assessed.",

Outcomes were assessed using a well\u2010validated pain scale, the Premature Infant Pain Profile. The reviewers found little to no difference between groups in duration of ventilation, mortality, length of hospitalization, necrotizing enterocolitis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular hemorrhage, and periventricular leukomalacia.

There likely was a large improvement in total autism symptom severity, a small improvement in quality of life, and an unclear effect on adverse events with music therapy (moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that music therapy may have little to no effect on social interaction and on non\u2010verbal communication. There seems to be little to no effect on verbal communication, but the evidence for this outcome was very uncertain.",

Research has found that music therapy can help improve social skills, communication, and behavior in individuals with autism. It can also help reduce anxiety, stress, and sensory overload. Music therapy can be especially beneficial for individuals with autism as it can help to stimulate their senses and promote emotional expression. Additionally, music therapy can help individuals with autism develop their cognitive skills, such as memory and attention, and can also help improve their self-esteem and self-awareness. It's important to note that music therapy is not a cure for autism, but it can be a valuable tool in helping individuals with autism to better manage their symptoms and improve their overall quality of life.",

Enhanced tracking and monitoring: RHISs allow for real-time monitoring of TB patients' progress, enabling healthcare providers to quickly identify and address treatment delays or failures.\n3. Streamlined reporting: Electronic systems simplify the process of reporting and analyzing data, enabling healthcare providers to track trends and identify areas for improvement.\n4. Improved patient tracking: RHISs can track patients' movements and treatment adherence, reducing the risk of patients losing contact with healthcare providers.\n5. Enhanced data security: Electronic systems protect patients' personal and medical information, ensuring confidentiality and security.\n6. Better data analysis: RHISs enable healthcare providers to perform advanced data analysis, identifying patterns and trends that can inform public health strategies.\n7. Improved patient engagement: Electronic systems can provide patients with personalized treatment plans, reminders, and education, improving their understanding and engagement in their care.\n8. Cost-effective: RHISs can reduce the costs associated with paper-based systems, such as data entry, storage, and transportation.\nIn summary, electronic RHISs offer several advantages over paper-based systems for improving the treatment of people with TB, including improved data quality, enhanced tracking and monitoring, streamlined reporting, improved patient tracking, enhanced data security, better data analysis, improved patient engagement, and cost-effectiveness.",

            "gold_answer": "Electronic routine health information systems (RHISs) reduce the length of time needed to report test results and reduce the number of recording errors for people with tuberculosis (TB). For people with TB, moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that compared with paper\u2010based systems, web\u2010based electronic TB laboratory information probably reduces length of time to report TB culture and TB drug susceptibility results (by a median of around 3 and 6 days, respectively) and probably reduces recording errors for both tests (on average, 128 and 96 fewer errors per 1000 records, respectively). For timeliness of starting or changing a patient's TB treatment, the evidence is very uncertain. Compared with paper\u2010based systems, a hand\u2010held electronic device for collecting TB laboratory information probably reduces the length of time needed to report TB culture and TB drug susceptibility results (by a mean of around 25 and 19 days, respectively) and probably reduces overall recording errors (on average, 35 fewer errors per 1000 records).",

            "llm_answer": "Electronic routine health information systems (RHISs) have several advantages over paper-based systems for improving the treatment of people with tuberculosis. Here are some of the benefits of using electronic RHISs:\n1. Improved data quality: Electronic RHISs can help reduce errors and inconsistencies in data entry, as well as provide real-time data that can be easily accessed and analyzed. This can lead to more accurate diagnoses and better treatment outcomes.\n2. Enhanced patient tracking: Electronic RHISs can facilitate the tracking of patient information, including test results, medication, and treatment progress, which can help healthcare providers monitor patients more effectively and provide timely interventions.\n3. Better data management: Electronic RHISs can store large amounts of data, which can be easily analyzed and used to identify trends and patterns in tuberculosis cases. This can help healthcare providers identify areas where interventions are needed and allocate resources more effectively.\n4. Improved communication: Electronic RHISs can facilitate communication between healthcare providers and patients, as well as between different healthcare facilities, which can help ensure that patients receive consistent and coordinated care.\n5. Increased efficiency: Electronic RHISs can automate routine tasks, such as data entry and reporting, which can save time and reduce the workload of healthcare providers, allowing them to focus on more complex and high-priority tasks.\nOverall, electronic RHISs have the potential to significantly improve the treatment of people with tuberculosis by providing more accurate and timely data, enhancing patient tracking and communication, and increasing efficiency. However, it is important to note that the implementation of electronic RHISs requires careful planning, training, and maintenance to ensure that they are used effectively and safely.",

            "gold_answer": "Adults and adolescents with drug\u2010resistant epilepsy probably benefit from treatment with brivaracetam, but more people may experience adverse events leading to withdrawal from treatment. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that when compared with placebo in adults and adolescents with drug\u2010resistant epilepsy, brivaracetam 5 to 200 mg/d in two equally divided doses probably leads to a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency in more people (313 vs 173 per 1000 people; all results on average) and to more people being completely seizure free (26 vs 4 per 1000 people). Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows there is probably little to no difference between groups in withdrawal for any cause; however, the proportion of people who withdrew from treatment due to adverse events was higher with brivaracetam than with placebo (59 vs 38 per 1000 people) (low\u2010certainty evidence). Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that slightly more people probably experienced any adverse event with brivaracetam than with placebo (637 vs 589 per 1000 people).",

In clinical trials, brivaracetam has been demonstrated to significantly reduce seizure frequency and improve quality of life measures compared to placebo. However, the response rate (the percentage of patients who experience a 50% or greater reduction in seizures) is relatively low, ranging from 10% to 30%. Additionally, brivaracetam can have side effects, including somnolence, dizziness, and fatigue. Therefore, while brivaracetam can be a useful adjunctive treatment option for some patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, it may not be effective for all patients and should be carefully evaluated on a case-by-case basis.",

            "gold_answer": "Adults and adolescents with drug\u2010resistant epilepsy probably benefit from treatment with brivaracetam, but more people may experience adverse events leading to withdrawal from treatment. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that when compared with placebo in adults and adolescents with drug\u2010resistant epilepsy, brivaracetam 5 to 200 mg/d in two equally divided doses probably leads to a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency in more people (313 vs 173 per 1000 people; all results on average) and to more people being completely seizure free (26 vs 4 per 1000 people). Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows there is probably little to no difference between groups in withdrawal for any cause; however, the proportion of people who withdrew from treatment due to adverse events was higher with brivaracetam than with placebo (59 vs 38 per 1000 people) (low\u2010certainty evidence). Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that slightly more people probably experienced any adverse event with brivaracetam than with placebo (637 vs 589 per 1000 people).",

            "llm_answer": "Brivaracetam, a synthetic compound that acts as a positive allosteric modulator of the synaptic vesicle protein SV2A, has been studied for its potential in reducing seizures in adults and adolescents with drug-resistant epilepsy.\nAccording to a systematic review and meta-analysis of three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials involving 1,032 participants with drug-resistant epilepsy, brivaracetam was associated with a significant reduction in seizure frequency compared to placebo. The pooled estimate of the proportion of patients who achieved a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency was 31.7% for brivaracetam and 17.9% for placebo.\nHowever, it's important to note that the quality of the evidence was moderate, and the studies had some limitations, such as small sample sizes and short treatment durations. Additionally, the long-term efficacy and safety of brivaracetam for this indication are not well established.\nTherefore, while brivaracetam may have potential as a treatment for drug-resistant epilepsy, further high-quality research is needed to confirm its efficacy and safety in this population. It's important for patients to discuss the potential benefits and risks of brivaracetam with their healthcare provider and to closely monitor their seizure activity and any adverse effects while taking the medication.",

            "gold_answer": "Blastocyst stage embryo transfer appears to be associated with higher live birth and clinical pregnancy rates when compared with cleavage stage in women aged less than 40 years undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that live births may be higher if the embryo transfers are performed at the blastocyst stage (day 5/6) compared with the cleavage stage (day 2/3) (384 vs 330 per 1000 women; all results on average), a difference that was irrespective of the number of embryos transferred. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence also shows a likely higher clinical pregnancy rate when transfers are done at the blastocyst stage (437 vs 383 per 1000 women). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that multiple pregnancy and miscarriage rates may be similar in both groups, and cumulative pregnancy rate may be higher at cleavage stage when slow freezing is used (538 vs 629 per 1000 women), but moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that the cumulative pregnancy is probably higher at the blastocyst stage if vitrification is used (550 vs 333 per 1000 women). Based on low\u2010 to moderate\u2010certainty evidence, there are lower embryo freezing rates (437 vs 620 per 1000 women) and higher failures to transfer embryos (89 vs 38 per 1000 women) when transferring embryos at blastocyst stage compared with cleavage stage.",

Cleavage stage embryos are typically transferred 2-3 days after fertilization, while blastocyst stage embryos are transferred 5-6 days after fertilization.\nCleavage stage embryos have a lower implantation rate compared to blastocyst stage embryos. This is because cleavage stage embryos are less developed and may not have had time to fully establish their implantation potential. In contrast, blastocyst stage embryos have had more time to develop and are more likely to implant successfully in the uterus.\nHowever, cleavage stage embryos have a lower risk of chromosomal abnormalities compared to blastocyst stage embryos. This is because blastocyst stage embryos have undergone more cell divisions and are more susceptible to errors during cell division, which can lead to chromosomal abnormalities.\nOverall, the choice between cleavage stage and blastocyst stage embryo transfer depends on various factors, including the patient's age, medical history, and embryo quality.

            "gold_answer": "Blastocyst stage embryo transfer appears to be associated with higher live birth and clinical pregnancy rates when compared with cleavage stage in women aged less than 40 years undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that live births may be higher if the embryo transfers are performed at the blastocyst stage (day 5/6) compared with the cleavage stage (day 2/3) (384 vs 330 per 1000 women; all results on average), a difference that was irrespective of the number of embryos transferred. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence also shows a likely higher clinical pregnancy rate when transfers are done at the blastocyst stage (437 vs 383 per 1000 women). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that multiple pregnancy and miscarriage rates may be similar in both groups, and cumulative pregnancy rate may be higher at cleavage stage when slow freezing is used (538 vs 629 per 1000 women), but moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that the cumulative pregnancy is probably higher at the blastocyst stage if vitrification is used (550 vs 333 per 1000 women). Based on low\u2010 to moderate\u2010certainty evidence, there are lower embryo freezing rates (437 vs 620 per 1000 women) and higher failures to transfer embryos (89 vs 38 per 1000 women) when transferring embryos at blastocyst stage compared with cleavage stage.",

            "llm_answer": "In assisted reproductive technology, the stage of embryo transfer can have an impact on the success rates of in vitro fertilization (IVF) and other fertility treatments. Here's a comparison of the effects of cleavage stage versus blastocyst stage embryo transfer:\nCleavage stage embryo transfer:\n* This type of transfer occurs 2-3 days after fertilization, when the embryo has undergone several cell divisions and is composed of 2-4 cells.\n* The embryo is still in the early stages of development, and it may not have had time to fully implant in the uterus.\n* The success rates of cleavage stage embryo transfer are generally lower compared to blastocyst stage transfer.\n* The risk of multiple pregnancies is higher with cleavage stage transfer, as multiple embryos are often transferred to increase the chances of success.\nBlastocyst stage embryo transfer:\n* This type of transfer occurs 5-6 days after fertilization, when the embryo has developed into a blastocyst, a more advanced stage of development.\n* The blastocyst has a higher chance of implanting in the uterus and resulting in a successful pregnancy.\n* The success rates of blastocyst stage transfer are generally higher compared to cleavage stage transfer.\n* The risk of multiple pregnancies is lower with blastocyst stage transfer, as only one or two embryos are typically transferred.\nIt's important to note that the choice between cleavage stage and blastocyst stage transfer depends on various factors, including the patient's age, the quality of the embryos, and the individual clinic's policies. Your fertility specialist will discuss the best options for your specific situation and help you make an informed decision.",

Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows imprecise results for mortality between PEEP levels (on average, 391 per vs 404 per 1000 people), but reviewers observed probable benefit of high PEEP levels in terms of oxygen efficiency at day 7 (on average, partial pressure of oxygen [PaO 2 ]/fraction of inspired oxygen [FiO 2 ] 28.52). High PEEP also resulted in improvements in oxygen efficiency at days 1 and 3, but the certainty of evidence at these time points was low.

High PEEP also resulted in improvements in oxygen efficiency at days 1 and 3, but the certainty of evidence at these time points was low. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests there may be little to no difference between PEEP levels in terms of ventilator\u2010free days and barotrauma (although results for this outcome were imprecise).",

However, high PEEP levels can also cause over-distension of the lungs, which can lead to lung damage and worsen respiratory failure.\nLow PEEP levels (typically below 6-8 cmH2O), on the other hand, may not provide enough support to recruit lung tissue and improve oxygenation in patients with ALI/ARDS. However, low PEEP levels may be associated with less lung damage and improved survival in some patient populations.\nIt's important to note that the optimal PEEP level for a patient with ALI/ARDS depends on various factors, such as the severity of lung injury, lung compliance, and hemodynamic status. The PEEP level should be individualized and titrated to the patient's response, and frequent monitoring of blood gases, lung mechanics, and clinical status is necessary to ensure that the PEEP level is appropriate.\nIn summary, while high PEEP levels may be beneficial for some patients with ALI/ARDS, low PEEP levels may be more appropriate for others. The optimal PEEP level should be carefully determined for each patient based on their individual needs and clinical status.",

Moderate\u2010quality evidence showed that this benefit was not sustained in the longer\u2010term (5 years). Low\u2010quality evidence suggests there was no benefit of an adjunctive corticosteroid in terms of reducing rates of disabling neurological deficit, ether within 24 months or at 5 years.

Studies have consistently demonstrated that corticosteroids reduce the risk of death and disability in patients with tuberculous meningitis, particularly in those with severe disease. The use of corticosteroids has been associated with a significant reduction in mortality rates, from approximately 30-40% in untreated patients to around 10-20% in patients receiving corticosteroids. Additionally, corticosteroids have been shown to reduce the risk of long-term disability, such as hearing loss and cognitive impairment.

Moderate\u2010quality evidence showed that this benefit was not sustained in the longer\u2010term (5 years). Low\u2010quality evidence suggests there was no benefit of an adjunctive corticosteroid in terms of reducing rates of disabling neurological deficit, ether within 24 months or at 5 years. There was no apparent impact of adjunctive corticosteroids on the incidences of hepatitis, hyperglycemia/glycosuria, gastrointestinal bleeding, or invasive bacterial infection but event rates were very low meaning conclusions cannot be drawn.",

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers found no conclusive RCT evidence suggesting that administration of probiotics to pregnant women was superior or inferior to placebo in reducing morbidity or mortality in preterm infants. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that in pregnant women who received probiotics, the risk of preterm birth (< 37 weeks) and miscarriage/stillbirth was no more or less likely compared with those who did not receive probiotics. Only one RCT (159 infants) reported no incidences of early neonatal sepsis (\u2264 3 days) in either trial arm. For most outcomes, event rates were very low or there were no events in both arms. There is a lack of data on neonatal short\u2010term (early or late sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, neonatal death, hospital stay) and long\u2010term (major neurodevelopmental disability) potential benefits or harms following probiotic administration. None of the trials included women with a previous history of preterm birth, multiple pregnancy, or uterine anomaly. Reviewers did not assess serious adverse maternal or neonatal adverse events following use of probiotics.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "RCT (rct): A study which tests the effectiveness and safety of treatments or procedures as fairly and objectively as possible. By randomly assigning patients to different treatments for the same problem, the results can be assessed equally with the aim of discovering the best possible procedure for the condition.\nPLACEBO (placebo): an inactive substance; a pill/liquid that contains no medicine\nMORBIDITY (morbidity): undesired result or complication\nMORTALITY (mortality): death\nRISK (risk): The chance that an activity or hazard will give rise to harm. Risk is generally given in terms of numerical odds (1 in 10) or percentages (10%).\nSEPSIS (sepsis): The immune system's overreaction to an infection or injury which can lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and death.\nPOTENTIAL (potential): possible\nPOTENTIATE (potentiate): increase or multiply the effect of a drug or toxin (poison) by giving another drug or toxin at the same time (sometimes an unintentional result)\nPOTENTIATOR (potentiator): an agent that helps another agent work better\nASSESS (assess): to learn about, measure, evaluate, look at",

            "llm_answer": "Yes, probiotics administered to pregnant women have been shown to help prevent morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that can help maintain a healthy gut microbiome, which is important for the development and function of various bodily systems, including the immune system.\nStudies have found that probiotics can help reduce the risk of preterm birth, which is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Probiotics have also been shown to reduce the risk of other complications in preterm infants, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious condition that can cause damage to the intestines.\nIt's important to note that not all probiotics are the same, and some strains have been found to be more effective than others in preventing morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. For example, the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any supplements during pregnancy, including probiotics, to ensure safety and effectiveness. Additionally, it's important to note that while probiotics can help reduce the risk of complications, they are not a guarantee against them, and other factors such as proper prenatal care, a healthy diet, and a safe delivery are also important for a healthy pregnancy and baby.",
