            "llm_answer": "Topical antibiotics and topical antiseptics are both effective treatments for chronic suppurative otitis media, but they work in different ways.\nTopical antibiotics, such as antibiotic ear drops, work by directly targeting the bacterial infection in the ear and helping to clear it up. They are particularly useful for people who have a bacterial infection that is causing symptoms such as discharge, odor, and pain.\nTopical antiseptics, on the other hand, work by reducing the number of bacteria on the skin and in the ear canal, which can help to prevent infection and promote healing. They are often used in combination with antibiotics to enhance their effectiveness.\nWhen comparing topical antibiotics and topical antiseptics, a study published in the Journal of Laryngology and Otology found that topical antibiotics were more effective in treating chronic suppurative otitis media than topical antiseptics. However, the study also noted that the combination of topical antibiotics and antiseptics was more effective than using either treatment alone.\nIt's important to note that the choice of treatment will depend on the severity and nature of the infection, as well as the individual's medical history and any allergies they may have. It's best to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the most appropriate treatment plan.\nIn summary, topical antibiotics and topical antiseptics are both effective treatments for chronic suppurative otitis media, but topical antibiotics may be more effective in treating bacterial infections. A combination of both treatments may be the most effective approach. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the best course of treatment.",

However, the certainty of the evidence was low for all outcomes. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that when compared with white light cystoscopy, blue light cystoscopy may result in a lower risk of disease recurrence. With risk stratification in terms of disease recurrence, the difference in risk increased with high\u2010 and intermediate\u2010risk disease (102 vs 150 per 1000 people with low risk, 271 vs 380 per 1000 people with intermediate risk, and 463 vs 610 per 1000 people with high risk; all results on average). Low\u2010certainty evidence also suggests that the risk of disease progression may be lower with blue light than with white light cystoscopy. Again, the rates of disease progression decreased depending on baseline risk, with the difference between groups becoming wider with increasing bladder cancer risk (1 vs 2 per 1000 people with low risk, 33 vs 50 per 1000 people with intermediate risk, and 114 vs 170 per 1000 people with high risk).

The main difference between the two is the type of light used to visualize the tumor during the procedure.\nWhite light cystoscopy uses traditional white light to illuminate the bladder and tumor, while blue light cystoscopy uses a special blue light that is selectively absorbed by the tumor, allowing for better visualization and detection of the cancerous cells.\nStudies have shown that blue light cystoscopy may have some advantages over white light cystoscopy, including:\n* Improved detection and removal of tumors: Blue light cystoscopy has been shown to improve the detection and removal of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer compared to white light cystoscopy. This is because the blue light allows for better visualization of the tumor, which can lead to more complete removal of the cancerous cells.\n* Reduced risk of recurrence: Blue light cystoscopy may also reduce the risk of recurrence of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer compared to white light cystoscopy. This is because the blue light can help to identify and remove any remaining cancerous cells that may have been missed during the initial procedure.\n* Shorter procedure time: Blue light cystoscopy may also have a shorter procedure time compared to white light cystoscopy, as the blue light can help to quickly identify the tumor and guide the surgeon during the resection process.\nHowever, it's important to note that blue light cystoscopy may not be suitable for all patients and the choice between blue light and white light cystoscopy should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account factors such as the size, location, and stage of the tumor, as well as the patient's overall health and medical history.\nIn summary, blue light cystoscopy may have some advantages over white light cystoscopy for adults undergoing transurethral resection of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, including improved detection and removal of tumors, reduced risk of recurrence, and shorter procedure time.

            "gold_answer": "For preterm infants (< 1000 to < 1501 g birthweight and/or < 28 to < 33 weeks' gestation), use of systemic CSs at seven days after birth or later reduced mortality (per 1000 infants, 34 fewer within 28 days, 69 fewer at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age, and 44 fewer at last reported age [high\u2010certainty evidence]; all results on average), incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (per 1000 infants, 91 fewer within 28 days, and 56 fewer at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age [moderate\u2010certainty evidence]), requirement for late rescue with CSs (222 fewer per 1000 infants), extubation failures by day 7 (274 fewer per 1000 infants), and requirement for oxygen at home (48 fewer per 1000 infants). However, more infants experienced complications: hyperglycemia (75 more per 1000 infants), hypertension (21 more per 1000 infants), gastrointestinal bleeding (14 more per 1000 infants), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (50 more per 1000 infants), and/or overall severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP; 61 more per 1000 infants; the result for severe ROP in survivors was inconclusive). Reviewers stated that no studies were powered to detect increased rates of important adverse long\u2010term neurodevelopmental outcomes.",

Improved lung function: CSs can help reduce inflammation and promote lung maturation, which can improve lung function and reduce the risk of chronic lung disease.\n2. Reduced risk of respiratory failure: CSs may help reduce the risk of respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation in preterm infants with BPD.\n3. Reduced risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia: CSs may help reduce the risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia, a chronic lung disease that can result from lung injury in preterm infants.\nNegative effects:\n1. Increased risk of infections: CSs can suppress the immune system, which can increase the risk of infections, particularly in preterm infants who are already at higher risk due to their prematurity.\n2. Adrenal insufficiency: Prolonged use of CSs can lead to adrenal insufficiency, a condition in which the adrenal glands do not produce enough cortisol, which can have serious consequences.\n3. Growth restriction: CSs can inhibit growth and affect bone development, particularly when used in high doses or for extended periods.\n4. Neurodevelopmental delays: CSs can affect brain development and have been associated with neurodevelopmental delays, particularly when used in high doses or for extended periods.\nIt is important to note that the benefits and risks of late (\u2265 7 days) systemic corticosteroids (CSs) in preterm infants with evolving or established bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) can vary depending on the individual infant and the specific clinical situation. The decision to use CSs should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the potential benefits and risks, as well as the infant's overall health and medical history.",

Improved overall survival: Studies have shown that the addition of abiraterone acetate to ADT significantly improves overall survival in men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.\n2. Reduced risk of radiographic progression: Abiraterone acetate has been shown to reduce the risk of radiographic progression, which is a measure of the cancer's ability to spread to other parts of the body.\n3. Improved prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response: PSA is a protein produced by the prostate gland, and a decrease in PSA levels can be an indicator of effective treatment. Abiraterone acetate has been shown to improve PSA response in men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.\n4. Improved quality of life: Some studies have suggested that abiraterone acetate may improve quality of life in men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, including improvements in pain, fatigue, and sexual function.\n5. Increased risk of certain side effects: Abiraterone acetate can cause certain side effects, including hypertension, hypokalemia, and liver toxicity. It's important for patients to be closely monitored for these side effects while taking the drug.\nIt's important to note that abiraterone acetate is not appropriate for all patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, and the decision to use it should be made on a case-by-case basis with the guidance of a healthcare professional.",

            "gold_answer": "Periodontal treatment for adults with diabetes mellitus may result in improved outcomes when compared with no active intervention or usual care. RCT evidence (mixed risk of bias) shows that periodontal disease treatment in people with diabetes using subgingival instrumentation alone or with the use of local or systemic antimicrobials or antimicrobial mouth rinses, compared with no treatment or usual care, probably offers a beneficial mean reduction of glycosylated hemoglobin values (HbA1c) 3 to 12 months after completion of treatment. For all the other outcomes used to assess periodontal disease improvements, such as gingival index, plaque index, clinical attachment level, bleeding on probing and probing pocket depths, the different periodontal treatments successfully improved periodontitis in people with diabetes, with or without adjuncts such as oral hygiene instruction and antimicrobials. For clinical practice, periodontal treatment alone or with adjuncts compared with no therapy seems to improve the hemoglobin glycosylated HbA1c and periodontal disease parameters in people with diabetes. Any improvements may be valuable, considering that uncontrolled diabetes is known for its detrimental consequences in the periodontal tissues. However, for glycemic control, for example in a person with diabetes with a current HbA1c of 8, after three to four months of periodontal treatment, the HbA1c would be reduced to around 7.97, which might be considered a very modest reduction. The results of the review, particularly regarding glycemic control and the quality of the supporting evidence, should be interpreted with caution by dentists and other healthcare providers for application in clinical practice.",

Studies have found that periodontal treatment can lead to significant improvements in HbA1c levels, fasting blood glucose levels, and other markers of glycemic control. The improvement in glycemic control is thought to be due to the reduction in systemic inflammation and the improvement in insulin sensitivity that occurs with periodontal treatment.

            "gold_answer": "Periodontal treatment for adults with diabetes mellitus may result in improved outcomes when compared with no active intervention or usual care. RCT evidence (mixed risk of bias) shows that periodontal disease treatment in people with diabetes using subgingival instrumentation alone or with the use of local or systemic antimicrobials or antimicrobial mouth rinses, compared with no treatment or usual care, probably offers a beneficial mean reduction of glycosylated hemoglobin values (HbA1c) 3 to 12 months after completion of treatment. For all the other outcomes used to assess periodontal disease improvements, such as gingival index, plaque index, clinical attachment level, bleeding on probing and probing pocket depths, the different periodontal treatments successfully improved periodontitis in people with diabetes, with or without adjuncts such as oral hygiene instruction and antimicrobials. For clinical practice, periodontal treatment alone or with adjuncts compared with no therapy seems to improve the hemoglobin glycosylated HbA1c and periodontal disease parameters in people with diabetes. Any improvements may be valuable, considering that uncontrolled diabetes is known for its detrimental consequences in the periodontal tissues. However, for glycemic control, for example in a person with diabetes with a current HbA1c of 8, after three to four months of periodontal treatment, the HbA1c would be reduced to around 7.97, which might be considered a very modest reduction. The results of the review, particularly regarding glycemic control and the quality of the supporting evidence, should be interpreted with caution by dentists and other healthcare providers for application in clinical practice.",

Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests little to no improvement in live birth/ongoing pregnancy rate with the use of progesterone versus placebo or no treatment (155 vs 141 per 1000 women; all results on average). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests little to no improvement in live birth/ongoing pregnancy rate with the addition of progesterone in women undergoing ovarian stimulation with gonadotrophin, gonadotrophin plus oral ovulogens, or oral ovulogens alone. It is unclear whether the use of progesterone reduces miscarriage rate per pregnancy, as the certainty of evidence was low (130 vs 185 per 1000 pregnancies) and the results were similar, irrespective of the stimulation protocol used. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that the clinical pregnancy rate may be higher following the use of vaginal progesterone in women undergoing stimulation with gonadotrophin, gonadotrophin plus oral ovulogens, or oral ovulogens alone. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests no difference in multiple pregnancy rate following the addition of progesterone. None of the trials reported adverse events or ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome rates.

            "gold_answer": "In women trying to conceive by intrauterine insemination or sexual intercourse, it is uncertain whether the addition of progesterone as luteal support results in a higher live birth/ongoing pregnancy rate or lower miscarriage rate compared with no progesterone. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests little to no improvement in live birth/ongoing pregnancy rate with the use of progesterone versus placebo or no treatment (155 vs 141 per 1000 women; all results on average). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests little to no improvement in live birth/ongoing pregnancy rate with the addition of progesterone in women undergoing ovarian stimulation with gonadotrophin, gonadotrophin plus oral ovulogens, or oral ovulogens alone. It is unclear whether the use of progesterone reduces miscarriage rate per pregnancy, as the certainty of evidence was low (130 vs 185 per 1000 pregnancies) and the results were similar, irrespective of the stimulation protocol used. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that the clinical pregnancy rate may be higher following the use of vaginal progesterone in women undergoing stimulation with gonadotrophin, gonadotrophin plus oral ovulogens, or oral ovulogens alone. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests no difference in multiple pregnancy rate following the addition of progesterone. None of the trials reported adverse events or ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome rates. For a comparison of different doses and routes of administration of progesterone as luteal phase support for women trying to conceive by intrauterine insemination or sexual intercourse, see CCA 4174 .",

            "llm_answer": "Progesterone as luteal phase support in women trying to conceive by intrauterine insemination or sexual intercourse can help to increase the chances of successful fertilization and implantation of the fertilized egg. Progesterone is a hormone that helps to prepare the uterus for pregnancy by thickening the uterine lining and creating a favorable environment for the developing embryo.\nStudies have shown that progesterone supplementation during the luteal phase can improve pregnancy rates in women undergoing assisted reproductive technology (ART) such as intrauterine insemination (IUI) or in vitro fertilization (IVF). Progesterone can help to:\n1. Support the growth and development of the embryo: Progesterone helps to create a favorable environment for the developing embryo by thickening the uterine lining and increasing the blood flow to the uterus.\n2. Prevent uterine contractions: Progesterone can help to prevent uterine contractions that can disrupt the implantation of the fertilized egg.\n3. Maintain a healthy pregnancy: Progesterone is essential for maintaining a healthy pregnancy, and supplementing with progesterone during the luteal phase can help to ensure that the uterus is properly prepared for the developing embryo.\nIt's important to note that progesterone supplementation should only be done under the guidance of a healthcare provider, as excessive levels of progesterone can have negative effects on the body. Additionally, progesterone supplementation may not be necessary for all women trying to conceive, and the decision to use progesterone should be made on an individual basis with the guidance of a healthcare provider.",

This can help prevent rebleeding from esophageal varices, which are enlarged veins in the esophagus that can rupture and bleed in people with cirrhosis.\nEndoscopic interventions, on the other hand, are minimally invasive procedures that use an endoscope (a flexible tube with a camera and light on the end) to visualize the esophageal varices and treat them with various techniques, such as ligation (tying off the varices), sclerotherapy (injecting a solution to scar the varices), or banding (placing a small band around the varices to constrict them).\nBoth portosystemic shunts and endoscopic interventions have been shown to be effective in preventing rebleeding in adults with cirrhosis, but they have different advantages and disadvantages. Portosystemic shunts are more invasive and require a longer recovery time, but they can provide more durable protection against rebleeding and may be more effective in patients with severe liver disease. Endoscopic interventions, on the other hand, are less invasive and have a faster recovery time, but they may need to be repeated more frequently to maintain their effectiveness.\nThe choice between portosystemic shunts and endoscopic interventions depends on various factors, such as the severity of liver disease, the size and location of the esophageal varices, and the patient's overall health status.

            "gold_answer": "Standardized tobacco packaging designs may be beneficial in decreasing prevalence of tobacco use and increasing smoking cessation attempts. Furthermore, these designs may result in increased concealment behaviors. Low\u2010certainty evidence from one large observational study supports the standardization of tobacco packaging to reduce the prevalence of tobacco use (from 19% to 18.5% one year after implementation). Further, use of standardized tobacco packaging was associated with increased numbers of people attempting to quit smoking; this was reported as an increase of 20% to 27% in one observational study, and as an increase in the number of calls to a smoking cessation helpline by 78% in another. Limited evidence from eight observational studies reported increased avoidance behaviors, such as concealing standardized cigarette packs or using a different container for cigarettes, avoiding looking at or thinking about the labels, and concealing standardized packs while in public. For change in tobacco consumption and perception of harm, studies reported mixed results, precluding a firm conclusion. Reviewers found no evidence assessing uptake, cessation, or relapse prevention. Only one country had implemented standardized packaging at the time of this review.",

Reducing the appeal of tobacco products: Standardized packaging eliminates the use of attractive colors, logos, and graphics that make tobacco products more appealing to consumers.\n2. Increasing the noticeability of health warnings: Standardized packaging requires larger and more prominent health warnings, which can increase awareness of the risks associated with tobacco use.\n3. Reducing the perceived quality of tobacco products: Standardized packaging can make tobacco products appear less premium or desirable, which can reduce their appeal to consumers.\n4. Increasing the perceived harm of tobacco products: Standardized packaging can make tobacco products appear more harmful or dangerous, which can increase the perceived risk of using them.\n5. Encouraging smokers to quit: Standardized packaging can make smokers more aware of the health risks associated with tobacco use and encourage them to quit.\nOverall, standardized tobacco packaging design can be an effective strategy for reducing tobacco use among adults by reducing the appeal of tobacco products and increasing awareness of the health risks associated with their use.",

            "gold_answer": "Standardized tobacco packaging designs may be beneficial in decreasing prevalence of tobacco use and increasing smoking cessation attempts. Furthermore, these designs may result in increased concealment behaviors. Low\u2010certainty evidence from one large observational study supports the standardization of tobacco packaging to reduce the prevalence of tobacco use (from 19% to 18.5% one year after implementation). Further, use of standardized tobacco packaging was associated with increased numbers of people attempting to quit smoking; this was reported as an increase of 20% to 27% in one observational study, and as an increase in the number of calls to a smoking cessation helpline by 78% in another. Limited evidence from eight observational studies reported increased avoidance behaviors, such as concealing standardized cigarette packs or using a different container for cigarettes, avoiding looking at or thinking about the labels, and concealing standardized packs while in public. For change in tobacco consumption and perception of harm, studies reported mixed results, precluding a firm conclusion. Reviewers found no evidence assessing uptake, cessation, or relapse prevention. Only one country had implemented standardized packaging at the time of this review.",

In neonates ranging from 1000 to 1499 g birth weight and 30 to 33 weeks' gestational age, low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that feed intervals of two hours (compared with three hours) resulted in no overall difference in time to achieve full enteral feeds (approximately \u20100.62 days). In extremely low birth weight infants (< 1000 g), short feeding intervals resulted in fewer days to achieve full enteral feeding (approximately three days fewer); these results should be interpreted with caution owing to the small sample size in the analysis. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that two\u2010hour (short) feeding intervals resulted in a longer time to regain birth weight (approximately 1.15 days longer).

            "gold_answer": "Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests there may be no clinically important differences between short and long feeding intervals for bolus feedings in very preterm infants. In neonates ranging from 1000 to 1499 g birth weight and 30 to 33 weeks' gestational age, low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that feed intervals of two hours (compared with three hours) resulted in no overall difference in time to achieve full enteral feeds (approximately \u20100.62 days). In extremely low birth weight infants (< 1000 g), short feeding intervals resulted in fewer days to achieve full enteral feeding (approximately three days fewer); these results should be interpreted with caution owing to the small sample size in the analysis. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that two\u2010hour (short) feeding intervals resulted in a longer time to regain birth weight (approximately 1.15 days longer). Reviewers found little to no difference between two\u2010hour and three\u2010hour intervals in duration of hospital stay, incidence of mortality, culture\u2010positive sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, hypoglycemia, or feed intolerance.",

Improved weight gain: Short feeding intervals result in more frequent, smaller feedings, which can help very preterm infants achieve optimal weight gain.\n2. Reduced risk of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC): NEC is a serious intestinal condition that can occur in preterm infants. Short feeding intervals may reduce the risk of NEC by preventing the buildup of formula or breastmilk in the gut.\n3. Better glucose control: Frequent feedings can help maintain stable blood sugar levels in very preterm infants, who may have immature glucose regulation.\n4. Improved gut maturation: Short feeding intervals can promote the maturation of the gut and reduce the risk of gut-related complications, such as gut dysmotility and intestinal perforation.\n5. Reduced risk of infection: Short feeding intervals may reduce the risk of infection by minimizing the amount of time that the infant's gut is exposed to potential pathogens.\nHowever, it's important to note that the optimal feeding interval for very preterm infants may vary depending on the individual infant's needs and medical condition. It's essential to consult with a healthcare provider to determine the most appropriate feeding schedule for your baby.",

Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that can help maintain a healthy gut microbiome, which is important for the development and function of various bodily systems, including the immune system.\nStudies have found that probiotics can help reduce the risk of preterm birth, which is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Probiotics have also been shown to reduce the risk of other complications in preterm infants, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious condition that can cause damage to the intestines.\nIt's important to note that not all probiotics are the same, and some strains have been found to be more effective than others in preventing morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. For example, the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any supplements during pregnancy, including probiotics, to ensure safety and effectiveness. Additionally, it's important to note that while probiotics can help reduce the risk of complications, they are not a guarantee against them, and other factors such as proper prenatal care, a healthy diet, and a safe delivery are also important for a healthy pregnancy and baby.",
