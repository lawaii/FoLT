            "gold_answer": "Single\u2010dose IV ketorolac may have similar efficacy to alternative NSAIDs but probably leads to more adverse events. More people may attain at least 50% pain relief over four to six hours and have a longer time to rescue medication with ketorolac than with opioids, but the evidence is uncertain. Compared with an alternative NSAID (parecoxib 20 or 40 mg, or diclofenac 3.75 to 75 mg) for adults with acute postoperative pain, moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that a single dose of ketorolac (30 mg IV) probably had a higher adverse event rate (662 vs 595 per 1000 people; all results on average) but offered minimal to no important benefit in terms of pain relief or use of rescue medication (low\u2010 to very low\u2010certainty evidence). Results for withdrawals due to adverse events were imprecise. Compared with opioids (morphine 4 mg, or butorphanol 2 mg), low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that more participants receiving ketorolac achieved at least 50% pain relief over four and six hours (493 vs 282 and 438 vs 231 per 1000 people, respectively) and had a longer time to rescue medication use (by 75 and 148 minutes). Analyses of rescue medication over four to six hours, adverse events, and withdrawals due to adverse events were underpowered. For both comparisons, respiratory depression and serious adverse events were too infrequent and/or were assessed in too few participants to permit conclusions.",

            "gold_answer": "For adults with chronic kidney disease who are on dialysis, GABA analogues (gabapentin and pregabalin) cause a large reduction in itch symptoms when compared with placebo (high\u2010certainty evidence). When compared with antihistamines, GABA analogues also are probably more effective for reducing itch (low\u2010certainty evidence). Whether GABA analogues are able to improve quality of life remains uncertain, as no RCTs assessed this outcome. Mild adverse events such as fatigue and dizziness occurred in fewer than 1 in 20 patients, and moderate to severe adverse events were rare.",

            "llm_answer": "Gabapentin and pregabalin, which are GABA analogues, have been studied for their potential effectiveness in reducing uremic itch associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in adults.\nA systematic review and meta-analysis published in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology in 2018 found that gabapentin and pregabalin were associated with a significant reduction in uremic itch compared to placebo in patients with CKD. The review included six randomized controlled trials that evaluated the use of gabapentin or pregabalin for uremic itch in CKD patients.\nAnother study published in the American Journal of Kidney Diseases in 2019 compared the effectiveness of pregabalin versus antihistamines in reducing uremic itch in CKD patients. The study found that pregabalin was more effective than antihistamines in reducing itch intensity and improving quality of life.\nIt's important to note that while GABA analogues may be effective in reducing uremic itch, they may have side effects, such as dizziness, somnolence, and fatigue. Additionally, the long-term safety and efficacy of these medications for uremic itch are not well established.\nIn summary, the available evidence suggests that GABA analogues, such as gabapentin and pregabalin, may be effective in reducing uremic itch associated with chronic kidney disease in adults, compared to placebo or antihistamines. However, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional to discuss the potential benefits and risks of these medications, as well as to determine the best course of treatment for each individual patient.",

It's also important to use appropriate methods of hair removal, such as clipping or shaving, and to follow proper surgical techniques to minimize the risk of infection.\nIt's worth noting that the evidence for the effectiveness of preoperative hair removal in preventing SSI is not yet definitive, and further research is needed to fully understand its impact. However, many healthcare organizations and guidelines recommend preoperative hair removal as a measure to reduce the risk of SSI.",

            "gold_answer": "In adults with Crohn's disease who had previously responded to open induction therapy, moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that certolizumab pegol is more likely to maintain clinical remission and response when compared with placebo, but findings regarding adverse events are uncertain. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that certolizumab pegol is less likely to cause failure to maintain clinical remission and failure to maintain clinical response at week 26 when compared with placebo (523 vs 717 per 1000 people and 375 vs 642 per 1000 people, respectively; all results on average); this result was consistent regardless of previous exposure to anti\u2010tumor necrosis factor alpha agents. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that certolizumab pegol may have little to no effect on the occurrence of serious adverse events during remission maintenance treatment when compared with placebo. The effect of certolizumab pegol on health\u2010related quality of life at week 26 is uncertain, as is the evidence regarding any adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events. It should be noted that the evidence came from one RCT with a small population limited to adults, a specific dose of certolizumab pegol, and a short duration of treatment, thus the results cannot be applied as a guide to different dosages of certolizumab, treatment of pediatric populations, or longer durations of therapy.",

            "gold_answer": "In adults with Crohn's disease who had previously responded to open induction therapy, moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that certolizumab pegol is more likely to maintain clinical remission and response when compared with placebo, but findings regarding adverse events are uncertain. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that certolizumab pegol is less likely to cause failure to maintain clinical remission and failure to maintain clinical response at week 26 when compared with placebo (523 vs 717 per 1000 people and 375 vs 642 per 1000 people, respectively; all results on average); this result was consistent regardless of previous exposure to anti\u2010tumor necrosis factor alpha agents. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that certolizumab pegol may have little to no effect on the occurrence of serious adverse events during remission maintenance treatment when compared with placebo. The effect of certolizumab pegol on health\u2010related quality of life at week 26 is uncertain, as is the evidence regarding any adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events. It should be noted that the evidence came from one RCT with a small population limited to adults, a specific dose of certolizumab pegol, and a short duration of treatment, thus the results cannot be applied as a guide to different dosages of certolizumab, treatment of pediatric populations, or longer durations of therapy.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "DISEASE (disease): An abnormal condition in the body causing harm.\nCLINICAL (clinical): pertaining to medical care\nREMISSION (remission): disappearance of evidence of cancer or other disease\nPLACEBO (placebo): an inactive substance; a pill/liquid that contains no medicine\nNECROSIS (necrosis): death of tissue\nRCT (rct): A study which tests the effectiveness and safety of treatments or procedures as fairly and objectively as possible.

            "llm_answer": "Certolizumab pegol is a medication used to treat Crohn's disease, a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It works by blocking a protein called tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) which is involved in the inflammation process.\nThe effects of certolizumab pegol for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease have been studied in clinical trials. According to the results, certolizumab pegol has been shown to be effective in maintaining remission in patients with Crohn's disease who have achieved remission with previous treatment.\nIn a clinical trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine, 50% of patients who received certolizumab pegol remained in remission at 26 weeks, compared to 25% of patients who received a placebo. Additionally, the trial showed that certolizumab pegol was effective in reducing symptoms and improving quality of life for patients with Crohn's disease.\nHowever, it's important to note that certolizumab pegol may not work for everyone and may have side effects. Common side effects of certolizumab pegol include injection site reactions, upper respiratory infections, and nausea.\nIt's important to consult a healthcare professional to determine the best treatment plan for Crohn's disease, as they can assess individual factors such as severity of disease, other health conditions, and medication history to determine the most appropriate therapy.",

Low\u2010dose atropine (< 0.1%) or pirenzepine 2% gel may also be more effective than placebo or no treatment, but the certainty of evidence was low to very low. Higher doses of atropine were associated with more adverse events (photophobia and blurred vision were most common) and higher numbers of withdrawals from the studies.",

Another study published in the British Journal of Ophthalmology found that pirenzepine, an anticholinergic medication, can slow myopia progression by 30%.\nHowever, it's important to note that these treatments may have side effects, such as blurred vision, and may not be suitable for all children. Additionally, the long-term effects of these treatments are not yet fully understood.\nIt's also worth noting that other methods, such as orthokeratology (OK) and multifocal contact lenses, have also been shown to slow myopia progression in children. OK involves wearing a specialized contact lens overnight to reshape the cornea, while multifocal contact lenses have different parts that focus on different distances.\nOverall, while pharmacological treatments can be effective in slowing myopia progression in children, more research is needed to fully understand their efficacy and safety.

Low\u2010dose atropine (< 0.1%) or pirenzepine 2% gel may also be more effective than placebo or no treatment, but the certainty of evidence was low to very low. Higher doses of atropine were associated with more adverse events (photophobia and blurred vision were most common) and higher numbers of withdrawals from the studies.",

            "llm_answer": "Pharmacological treatments for slowing myopia progression in children can be effective to some extent. Studies have shown that certain medications, such as atropine eye drops and pirenzepine gel, can slow down the progression of myopia in children. However, it's important to note that these treatments may not completely stop myopia progression and may have side effects.\nAtropine eye drops, for example, have been shown to slow down myopia progression by around 50% over a two-year period in children. However, the long-term effects of atropine use are not yet fully understood, and it's important to monitor the child's vision closely while using these drops.\nPirenzepine gel, another medication that has been studied for myopia control, has been shown to slow down myopia progression by around 30% over a one-year period. However, like atropine, its long-term effects are not yet fully understood.\nIt's important to note that these treatments may not work for every child, and the best approach may vary depending on the individual child's needs. It's also important to consider other methods of myopia control, such as orthokeratology (OK) and multifocal contact lenses, which have also been shown to be effective in slowing myopia progression.\nIt's important to consult with an eye doctor or an ophthalmologist to determine the best course of treatment for your child's myopia. They will be able to assess your child's individual needs and recommend the most appropriate treatment options.",

Improved motor planning and execution: Observing others perform motor tasks can help improve motor planning and execution by providing a cognitive template for the task.\n2. Enhanced neural plasticity: Action observation can stimulate neural activity in the brain, leading to increased neural plasticity and potentially improving motor function.\n3. Reduced motor fatigue: Observing others perform tasks can reduce motor fatigue by allowing the individual to mentally rehearse the task without physically performing it.\n4. Improved motivation and engagement: Watching others perform tasks can increase motivation and engagement in rehabilitation exercises.\nHarms:\n1. Over-reliance on observation: Relying too heavily on action observation may lead to a lack of physical practice, which is essential for motor recovery.\n2. Incorrect technique: Observing others perform tasks with incorrect technique can lead to the learning of inefficient or harmful movement patterns.\n3. Decreased self-efficacy: Watching others perform tasks that are difficult or impossible for the individual to perform can lead to decreased self-efficacy and discouragement.\n4. Distraction: Action observation can be distracting, especially if the observer is not focused on the task or is distracted by other stimuli.\nIn conclusion, action observation can be a useful tool in upper limb rehabilitation after stroke, but it should be used in conjunction with physical practice and under the guidance of a trained therapist to ensure that it is used effectively and safely.",

            "gold_answer": "For adults with upper limb motor deficit after stroke, RCT evidence suggests that use of action observation (physical rehabilitation that facilitates the occurrence of neural plasticity through activation of the mirror\u2010neural system) improves arm and hand function (low\u2010certainty evidence). Little to no difference was reported for dependence on activities of daily living but evidence was of very low certainty. However, the magnitude of these effects is uncertain, as participant numbers were generally low and results imprecise. Analyses of motor performance, quality of life, and adverse events were conducted in too few participants (16 to 83 participants) to be clinically useful.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "RCT (rct): A study which tests the effectiveness and safety of treatments or procedures as fairly and objectively as possible. By randomly assigning patients to different treatments for the same problem, the results can be assessed equally with the aim of discovering the best possible procedure for the condition.\nCLINICAL (clinical): pertaining to medical care",

            "llm_answer": "Action observation, which involves watching someone else perform a task or action, can be a useful tool for adults with upper limb rehabilitation after a stroke. The benefits of action observation for this population include:\n1. Improved motor planning and execution: Observing someone else perform a movement can help individuals with stroke learn new ways to perform tasks and improve their motor planning and execution.\n2. Enhanced neural plasticity: Action observation can stimulate the brain's motor areas and promote neural plasticity, which can help improve motor function and reduce the risk of motor decline.\n3. Increased motivation and engagement: Watching someone else perform a task can be motivating and engaging, which can encourage individuals to participate in their own rehabilitation and practice the observed movements.\n4. Better understanding of movement patterns: Observing the proper movement patterns and techniques can help individuals with stroke understand how to perform tasks more effectively and correctly.\nHowever, there are also potential harms associated with action observation for adults with upper limb rehabilitation after stroke, including:\n1. Overreliance on observation: Relying too heavily on observation without practicing the movements themselves can hinder progress and limit improvement.\n2. Incorrect observation: Observing incorrect movement patterns or techniques can lead to the learning of bad habits and poor motor control.\n3. Lack of individualization: Action observation may not be tailored to the individual's specific needs and abilities, which can lead to ineffective or even harmful practice.\n4. Demotivation: Watching someone else perform a task with ease may lead to feelings of inadequacy or frustration, potentially demotivating individuals from continuing their rehabilitation.\nIn conclusion, action observation can be a valuable tool for adults with upper limb rehabilitation after stroke, but it should be used in conjunction with active practice and tailored to the individual's specific needs and abilities. It is important to work with a qualified therapist or healthcare professional to ensure that the observation is done safely and effectively.",

            "gold_answer": "While zinc supplementation has been shown to likely reduce diarrhea and slightly improve height, it has not been shown to reduce lower respiratory tract infection and malaria or mortality attributable to these illnesses (and is associated with some adverse effects). Balancing its benefits and harms in the context of specific settings, zinc supplementation may be considered as part of a wider public health intervention in settings with high risks of zinc deficiency. High\u2010certainty evidence shows similar rates of all\u2010cause mortality in children (aged 6 months to 12 years) who received zinc and children who did not. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that mortality attributable to specific causes, including diarrhea, lower respiratory tract infections and malaria, was likely similar in zinc\u2010supplemented children and non\u2010supplemented children. Zinc\u2010supplemented children were less likely to have diarrhea from any cause (572 vs 628 per 1000 children; all results on average), based on moderate\u2010certainty evidence. However, there was little to no difference between groups in rates of lower respiratory tract infection and malaria. Despite the fact that children receiving zinc appeared to be taller than their non\u2010zinc\u2010supplemented counterparts (moderate\u2010certainty evidence), the difference in height was modest at best in all periods of comparison, and appeared to be greater in older children. Zinc\u2010supplemented children were more likely to experience some adverse effects compared to non\u2010zinc\u2010supplemented children (647 vs 573 per 1000 children, based on three RCTs with 850 participants). In particular, high\u2010certainty evidence showed that more zinc\u2010supplemented children had at least one vomiting episode compared to children receiving no zinc or placebo (29 vs 22 per 1000 children).",

            "gold_answer": "While zinc supplementation has been shown to likely reduce diarrhea and slightly improve height, it has not been shown to reduce lower respiratory tract infection and malaria or mortality attributable to these illnesses (and is associated with some adverse effects). Balancing its benefits and harms in the context of specific settings, zinc supplementation may be considered as part of a wider public health intervention in settings with high risks of zinc deficiency. High\u2010certainty evidence shows similar rates of all\u2010cause mortality in children (aged 6 months to 12 years) who received zinc and children who did not. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that mortality attributable to specific causes, including diarrhea, lower respiratory tract infections and malaria, was likely similar in zinc\u2010supplemented children and non\u2010supplemented children. Zinc\u2010supplemented children were less likely to have diarrhea from any cause (572 vs 628 per 1000 children; all results on average), based on moderate\u2010certainty evidence. However, there was little to no difference between groups in rates of lower respiratory tract infection and malaria. Despite the fact that children receiving zinc appeared to be taller than their non\u2010zinc\u2010supplemented counterparts (moderate\u2010certainty evidence), the difference in height was modest at best in all periods of comparison, and appeared to be greater in older children. Zinc\u2010supplemented children were more likely to experience some adverse effects compared to non\u2010zinc\u2010supplemented children (647 vs 573 per 1000 children, based on three RCTs with 850 participants). In particular, high\u2010certainty evidence showed that more zinc\u2010supplemented children had at least one vomiting episode compared to children receiving no zinc or placebo (29 vs 22 per 1000 children).",

            "llm_answer": "Yes, there is evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to support the use of zinc supplementation in children for preventing mortality, morbidity, and growth failure. Zinc is an essential nutrient that plays a crucial role in many physiological processes, including immune function, growth, and development. Deficiencies in zinc can lead to a range of negative health outcomes, particularly in children.\nSeveral RCTs have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of zinc supplementation in preventing mortality, morbidity, and growth failure in children. A systematic review and meta-analysis published in 2011 by the Cochrane Collaboration pooled data from 17 RCTs that included a total of 102,458 children. The review found that zinc supplementation significantly reduced the risk of mortality, morbidity, and growth failure in children, particularly in those under the age of five.\nThe authors of the review concluded that zinc supplementation appears to be a safe and effective intervention for preventing mortality, morbidity, and growth failure in children, particularly in populations with high levels of zinc deficiency or insufficiency. However, they noted that the quality of the evidence was generally low, and that further research is needed to determine the optimal dosage and duration of zinc supplementation.\nIt's important to note that while zinc supplementation can be beneficial, it's also important to ensure that children receive adequate nutrition and healthcare overall. Zinc supplementation should not be used as a substitute for a balanced diet and proper healthcare, but rather as a complement to support overall health and well-being.",

Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that can help maintain a healthy gut microbiome, which is important for the development and function of various bodily systems, including the immune system.\nStudies have found that probiotics can help reduce the risk of preterm birth, which is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Probiotics have also been shown to reduce the risk of other complications in preterm infants, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious condition that can cause damage to the intestines.\nIt's important to note that not all probiotics are the same, and some strains have been found to be more effective than others in preventing morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. For example, the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any supplements during pregnancy, including probiotics, to ensure safety and effectiveness. Additionally, it's important to note that while probiotics can help reduce the risk of complications, they are not a guarantee against them, and other factors such as proper prenatal care, a healthy diet, and a safe delivery are also important for a healthy pregnancy and baby.",
