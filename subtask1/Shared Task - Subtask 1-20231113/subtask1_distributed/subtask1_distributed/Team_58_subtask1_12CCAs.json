Outcomes assessed were symptom severity (Children's Depression Rating Scale [CDRS\u2010R] scores), self\u2010rated depression symptoms, remission, functioning, suicidal behaviors, and adverse events. Few results showed a clear difference between antidepressants, with most findings too imprecise to draw any conclusion of equivalence or benefit of one drug over another. Reviewers identified no trials assessing depressive disorder (based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [DSM] or International Classification of Diseases [ICD] criteria) or suicide.",

Compared to older antidepressants, such as tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), SSRIs and SNRIs have a more favorable side effect profile and are generally better tolerated. However, their efficacy in treating pediatric depression is similar to that of older antidepressants, with response rates ranging from 50% to 70%. It's important to note that antidepressants should be used in conjunction with psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to maximize treatment effectiveness.",

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers performed network meta\u2010analyses (NMAs) comparing new\u2010generation antidepressants for treating children and adolescents (age range 6 to 18 years) with symptoms of depression. Outcomes assessed were symptom severity (Children's Depression Rating Scale [CDRS\u2010R] scores), self\u2010rated depression symptoms, remission, functioning, suicidal behaviors, and adverse events. Few results showed a clear difference between antidepressants, with most findings too imprecise to draw any conclusion of equivalence or benefit of one drug over another. Reviewers identified no trials assessing depressive disorder (based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [DSM] or International Classification of Diseases [ICD] criteria) or suicide.",

However, I can provide some general information about new-generation antidepressants and their potential benefits and risks for children and adolescents with depression.\nNew-generation antidepressants, also known as second-generation antidepressants, refer to a class of medications that were introduced in the 1990s and 2000s. They include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs). These medications work by altering the levels of certain neurotransmitters in the brain, such as serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, which can help improve mood and reduce symptoms of depression.\nCompared to older antidepressants, new-generation antidepressants are thought to have a more favorable risk-benefit profile, with fewer side effects and a lower risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior. However, it's important to note that antidepressants can have different effects on different people, and it's important to work closely with a healthcare provider to find the right medication and dosage.\nA 2019 systematic review and meta-analysis published in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry found that new-generation antidepressants were generally effective in treating major depressive disorder (MDD) in children and adolescents. However, the study also noted that the quality of evidence was variable and that more research is needed to determine the long-term effects of these medications.\nIt's important to note that antidepressants should not be used as a sole treatment for depression. They should be used in conjunction with other therapies, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to address the underlying causes of depression and to help children and adolescents develop healthy coping strategies.\nIn summary, new-generation antidepressants may be effective in",

            "gold_answer": "Walking at home, in the community, or in a laboratory environment is associated with a reduction in systolic blood pressure (moderate\u2010certainty evidence), as well as in diastolic blood pressure and heart rate (low\u2010certainty evidence), compared with no intervention. Information regarding adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events was limited, but when adverse events were reported, they were rare, and most were related to physical injury. For people aged 16 and older, moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that three to five weekly moderate\u2010intensity walking sessions of 20 to 40 minutes per session lowered systolic blood pressure over an average 15\u2010week period (mean difference of around 4.11 mmHg) compared with no intervention. A similar reduction was observed in all age groups above 16 years and in both genders. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that walking lowered diastolic pressure (mean difference of around 1.79 mmHg) and heart rate (mean difference of around 2.76 bpm). A limited number of studies reported adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events, and these studies posed high risk of bias. Knee pain or injury was the most commonly reported adverse event.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "SYSTOLIC (systolic): top number in blood pressure; pressure during active contraction of the heart\nDIASTOLIC (diastolic): lower number in a blood pressure reading\nPERIOD (period): A bleed from the vagina between every 3 to 5 weeks which forms part of the menstrual cycle (see menstrual cycle).\nRISK (risk): The chance that an activity or hazard will give rise to harm. Risk is generally given in terms of numerical odds (1 in 10) or percentages (10%).",

            "gold_answer": "Walking at home, in the community, or in a laboratory environment is associated with a reduction in systolic blood pressure (moderate\u2010certainty evidence), as well as in diastolic blood pressure and heart rate (low\u2010certainty evidence), compared with no intervention. Information regarding adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events was limited, but when adverse events were reported, they were rare, and most were related to physical injury. For people aged 16 and older, moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that three to five weekly moderate\u2010intensity walking sessions of 20 to 40 minutes per session lowered systolic blood pressure over an average 15\u2010week period (mean difference of around 4.11 mmHg) compared with no intervention. A similar reduction was observed in all age groups above 16 years and in both genders. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that walking lowered diastolic pressure (mean difference of around 1.79 mmHg) and heart rate (mean difference of around 2.76 bpm). A limited number of studies reported adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events, and these studies posed high risk of bias. Knee pain or injury was the most commonly reported adverse event.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "SYSTOLIC (systolic): top number in blood pressure; pressure during active contraction of the heart\nDIASTOLIC (diastolic): lower number in a blood pressure reading\nPERIOD (period): A bleed from the vagina between every 3 to 5 weeks which forms part of the menstrual cycle (see menstrual cycle).\nRISK (risk): The chance that an activity or hazard will give rise to harm. Risk is generally given in terms of numerical odds (1 in 10) or percentages (10%).",

            "llm_answer": "Walking is a low-impact exercise that can help prevent and control hypertension (high blood pressure) in several ways. Some benefits of walking for hypertension include:\nBenefits:\n1. Lowers blood pressure: Regular walking can help lower resting blood pressure and reduce the risk of developing hypertension.\n2. Improves cardiovascular health: Walking can improve cardiovascular health by strengthening the heart and increasing blood flow, which can help reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular conditions.\n3. Reduces stress: Walking can help reduce stress levels, which can contribute to high blood pressure.\n4. Increases physical activity: Walking is a form of physical activity that can help increase overall physical activity levels, which can reduce the risk of developing hypertension.\n5. Improves sleep: Walking can help improve sleep quality, which can also contribute to lower blood pressure.\nHarms:\n1. Overexertion: Walking can be harmful if you overexert yourself, especially in hot weather or if you have a pre-existing medical condition. It's important to start slowly and gradually increase your walking intensity and duration.\n2. Injury: Walking can cause injury if you don't wear proper footwear or if you have a pre-existing condition that affects your mobility. It's important to wear comfortable shoes and consult with a doctor before starting a new exercise routine.\n3. Negative impact on joints: Walking can have a negative impact on joints, especially for people with joint problems or arthritis. It's important to choose a walking route that is flat and even, and to avoid overstriding or putting too much pressure on your joints.\nOverall, walking can be a safe and effective way to prevent and control hypertension, as long as you start slowly and gradually increase your intensity and duration, and take precautions to avoid overexertion, injury, and negative impact on joints. It's always a good idea to consult with a doctor before starting a new exercise routine.",

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers conducted an overview of Cochrane Reviews and found that salbutamol may reduce the duration of tachypnea compared with control. The evidence for \u03b2\u2010agonists, corticosteroids, diuretics, fluid restriction, and non\u2010invasive respiratory support was very uncertain or unavailable for this and other outcomes. For transient tachypnea of the newborn, low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that, compared with control, salbutamol may reduce the duration of tachypnea by about 17 hours (all results on average). There may be minimal to no effect of \u03b2\u2010agonists on the need for mechanical ventilation, time to established breastfeeding or bottle\u2010feeding, hospital stay, and adverse events, but the evidence was very uncertain. No study reported on respiratory distress or neonatal mortality. Compared with control, there may be minimal to no effect of corticosteroids, diuretics, or fluid restriction on hospital stay and adverse events; corticosteroids on the need for mechanical ventilation, time to established breastfeeding or bottle\u2010feeding, and respiratory distress; diuretics on the duration of tachypnea; and fluid restriction on the need for mechanical ventilation, but the evidence was very uncertain. No study reported neonatal mortality. Duration of tachypnea may be shorter with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) than with free\u2010flow oxygen (by 21 hours), and with nasal high\u2010frequency (oscillation) ventilation (NHFV) than with CPAP (by 5 hours), with minimal to no difference for this outcome between nasal intermittent positive\u2010pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and CPAP, but the evidence was very uncertain. Evidence on the effects of these non\u2010invasive respiratory support systems on the need for mechanical ventilation, hospital stay, neonatal mortality, and adverse events is also very uncertain. No study reported time to breastfeeding or bottle\u2010feeding or respiratory distress.",

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers conducted an overview of Cochrane Reviews and found that salbutamol may reduce the duration of tachypnea compared with control. The evidence for \u03b2\u2010agonists, corticosteroids, diuretics, fluid restriction, and non\u2010invasive respiratory support was very uncertain or unavailable for this and other outcomes. For transient tachypnea of the newborn, low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that, compared with control, salbutamol may reduce the duration of tachypnea by about 17 hours (all results on average). There may be minimal to no effect of \u03b2\u2010agonists on the need for mechanical ventilation, time to established breastfeeding or bottle\u2010feeding, hospital stay, and adverse events, but the evidence was very uncertain. No study reported on respiratory distress or neonatal mortality. Compared with control, there may be minimal to no effect of corticosteroids, diuretics, or fluid restriction on hospital stay and adverse events; corticosteroids on the need for mechanical ventilation, time to established breastfeeding or bottle\u2010feeding, and respiratory distress; diuretics on the duration of tachypnea; and fluid restriction on the need for mechanical ventilation, but the evidence was very uncertain. No study reported neonatal mortality. Duration of tachypnea may be shorter with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) than with free\u2010flow oxygen (by 21 hours), and with nasal high\u2010frequency (oscillation) ventilation (NHFV) than with CPAP (by 5 hours), with minimal to no difference for this outcome between nasal intermittent positive\u2010pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and CPAP, but the evidence was very uncertain. Evidence on the effects of these non\u2010invasive respiratory support systems on the need for mechanical ventilation, hospital stay, neonatal mortality, and adverse events is also very uncertain. No study reported time to breastfeeding or bottle\u2010feeding or respiratory distress.",

Interventions for TTN can have both benefits and harms, which are as follows:\nBenefits:\n1. Improved oxygenation: Interventions such as oxygen therapy, nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), and mechanical ventilation can help improve oxygenation in newborns with TTN, which can reduce the risk of hypoxic damage to the brain and other organs.\n2. Reduced respiratory distress: Interventions can help reduce the signs of respiratory distress, such as tachypnea, grunting, and flaring, which can help the baby feel more comfortable and reduce the risk of respiratory failure.\n3. Shortened hospital stay: With appropriate interventions, newborns with TTN may require a shorter hospital stay, which can reduce the risk of nosocomial infections and other complications associated with prolonged hospitalization.\nHarms:\n1. Risk of over-oxygenation: Excessive oxygen therapy can lead to over-oxygenation, which can cause respiratory and metabolic acidosis, and potentially damage the lungs and other organs.\n2. Risk of infection: Interventions such as endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation can increase the risk of infection, especially if proper sterilization and infection control practices are not followed.\n3. Discomfort and stress: Interventions can cause discomfort and stress for the baby, especially if they are not properly sedated or if the interventions are not carefully monitored and managed.\n4. Cost: Interventions for TTN can be expensive, especially if the baby requires prolonged mechanical ventilation or other intensive care services.\n5. Potential for long-term lung damage: Prolonged use of high-frequency oscillation ventilation, a type of mechanical ventilation, has been associated with long-term lung damage in some studies.\nIt's important to note that the benefits and harms of",

Vaccine services were sometimes provided opportunistically (e.g. during other healthcare appointments) or at designated time points (e.g. during vaccination days), and HCWs showed differences in the extent to which they regarded vaccine services as part of their roles and responsibilities. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests HCWs believed they had limited knowledge about vaccination for older adults and viewed ongoing training as important, but some felt there was lack of time for training. All studies were conducted in high\u2010income countries, which could limit the generalizability of the results.",

Evidence suggests that metronidazole may be more effective than lincosamides for resolution of ear discharge (on average, 700 vs 517 per 1000 people, based on 119 participants). As for other comparisons of efficacy and all assessments of adverse events/complications, the certainty of evidence is low to very low and the results imprecise, or evidence from only very small or no RCTs is available.",

            "llm_answer": "Systemic antibiotics are commonly used to treat chronic suppurative otitis media, which is a persistent middle ear infection that causes discharge or pus in the ear. The effects of systemic antibiotics on chronic suppurative otitis media can include:\n1. Reduced symptoms: Systemic antibiotics can help reduce the symptoms of chronic suppurative otitis media, such as ear discharge, pain, and fever.\n2. Eradication of infection: Systemic antibiotics can help eradicate the infection and prevent it from spreading to other parts of the head and neck.\n3. Improved hearing: Systemic antibiotics can help improve hearing loss caused by the infection.\n4. Reduced risk of complications: Systemic antibiotics can help reduce the risk of complications such as mastoiditis, meningitis, and facial nerve paralysis.\n5. Shorter treatment duration: Systemic antibiotics can help shorten the treatment duration for chronic suppurative otitis media.\nIt's important to note that systemic antibiotics should only be prescribed by a healthcare professional and used under their close supervision. Overuse or misuse of antibiotics can lead to antibiotic resistance, which can make infections harder to treat in the future. Additionally, antibiotics can have side effects, so it's important to discuss any concerns with a healthcare professional.",

            "gold_answer": "Intermittent exotropia in children can lead to embarrassment and bullying and may lead to loss of binocular single vision; hence, intervention is requested. High\u2010quality evidence showed that compared with observation, patching reduced the measured angle of motor alignment for near (around \u22122.23 prism diopters) and distance (around \u22122.00 prism diopters) in a group of children aged 12 months to 10 years, patched for 5 months and observed at 1 month after patching ceased (measured using the Prism Alternating Cover Test). There was no measurable difference in stereoacuity based on a single trial in children aged mean six years. However, stereopsis, control of squint, binocular single vision, quality of life, and adverse effects were not reported, nor were longer\u2010term results so the overall benefits of this intervention remain uncertain.",

            "llm_answer": "Patching and observation are both common treatments for children with intermittent exotropia, a type of strabismus where the eye turns outward occasionally. Patching involves covering the non-turning eye with a patch to force the child to use the turning eye, while observation involves monitoring the child's eye alignment and prescribing glasses or prisms if necessary.\nPatching can be effective in improving eye alignment and reducing the frequency of exotropia, especially in children under the age of 5. However, it can also cause some discomfort and frustration for the child, and may not be effective in all cases.\nObservation, on the other hand, is a more conservative approach that allows the child's vision to develop naturally. It may be recommended for children who have a small angle of exotropia or who have other vision problems that could be affected by patching.\nUltimately, the choice between patching and observation will depend on the severity and frequency of the exotropia, the child's age and overall health, and the preferences of the child and their family. It's important to discuss the options with a pediatric ophthalmologist to determine the best course of treatment for the child.",

            "gold_answer": "Intermittent exotropia in children can lead to embarrassment and bullying and may lead to loss of binocular single vision; hence, intervention is requested. High\u2010quality evidence showed that compared with observation, patching reduced the measured angle of motor alignment for near (around \u22122.23 prism diopters) and distance (around \u22122.00 prism diopters) in a group of children aged 12 months to 10 years, patched for 5 months and observed at 1 month after patching ceased (measured using the Prism Alternating Cover Test). There was no measurable difference in stereoacuity based on a single trial in children aged mean six years. However, stereopsis, control of squint, binocular single vision, quality of life, and adverse effects were not reported, nor were longer\u2010term results so the overall benefits of this intervention remain uncertain.",

            "llm_answer": "Patching and observation are both common treatments for children with intermittent exotropia, a type of strabismus where the eye turns outward occasionally.\nPatching involves covering the non-strabismic eye with a patch to force the child to use the strabismic eye. This can help strengthen the muscles in the strabismic eye and improve its alignment. Patching can be done for a few hours a day, usually during waking hours, and can be continued for several weeks or months.\nObservation, on the other hand, involves monitoring the child's eye alignment regularly without any active treatment. This approach is often recommended for children with mild intermittent exotropia, as their eye alignment may improve on its own over time.\nBoth patching and observation have their own advantages and disadvantages. Patching can be effective in improving eye alignment, but it can be inconvenient for children, especially if they need to wear a patch for extended periods. Observation, while less invasive, may not be as effective in improving eye alignment, and parents may need to monitor their child's eyes closely to detect any changes.\nUltimately, the choice between patching and observation depends on the severity of the child's intermittent exotropia, their age, and other individual factors. An eye doctor or orthoptist can assess the child's condition and recommend the most appropriate treatment. It's essential to follow their recommendations closely and monitor the child's progress to ensure the best possible outcome.",

            "llm_answer": "Ultra-radical (extensive) surgery and standard surgery are two different approaches used to treat women with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer. The main difference between the two is the extent of tissue removal during surgery.\nStandard surgery for ovarian cancer typically involves removing the uterus, tubes, and ovaries (hysterectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy), as well as any visible tumor masses in the pelvis and abdomen. This approach is considered adequate for most women with advanced ovarian cancer.\nUltra-radical surgery, on the other hand, involves more extensive tissue removal, including parts of the bowel, bladder, and other organs that may be affected by the cancer. This approach is sometimes referred to as \"debulking\" surgery.\nStudies have shown that ultra-radical surgery may improve survival rates for some women with advanced ovarian cancer, particularly those with stage III or IV disease. However, the benefits of this approach are not universal and may depend on various factors, such as the patient's overall health, the extent of the cancer, and the skill of the surgical team.\nIt's important to note that ultra-radical surgery is associated with a higher risk of complications and side effects compared to standard surgery. These may include bowel obstruction, urinary problems, and sexual dysfunction. Additionally, the recovery time for ultra-radical surgery is typically longer than for standard surgery.\nIn summary, while ultra-radical surgery may offer some benefits for select patients with advanced ovarian cancer, it's not suitable for everyone and should only be considered in consultation with a qualified healthcare professional. It's essential to weigh the potential risks and benefits carefully and make an informed decision based on individual circumstances.",

Moreover, based on low\u2010 to moderate\u2010certainty evidence, there is little to no difference in major or minor bleeding when comparing fondaparinux with heparin or dalteparin with tinzaparin. None of the trials reported data on quality of life, postphlebitic syndrome, or thrombocytopenia among the different anticoagulant strategies used.",

Here's a concise comparison of the commonly used anticoagulants for VTE treatment in cancer patients:\n1. Warfarin:\n\t* Advantages: Well-established use, effective, and relatively inexpensive.\n\t* Disadvantages: Requires frequent monitoring, dietary restrictions, and potential drug interactions.\n2. Low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs):\n\t* Advantages: Easy to administer, once-daily dosing, and fewer drug interactions.\n\t* Disadvantages: More expensive than warfarin, may require monitoring, and potential for bleeding complications.\n3. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs):\n\t* Advantages: Easy to administer, fixed dosing, and fewer drug interactions.\n\t* Disadvantages: More expensive than warfarin, may require monitoring, and potential for bleeding complications.\n4. Heparin plus vitamin K antagonist (VKA):\n\t* Advantages: Combination therapy may offer improved efficacy and safety.\n\t* Disadvantages: Increased risk of bleeding, requires frequent monitoring, and potential drug interactions.\n5. Thrombolysis:\n\t* Advantages: Rapidly dissolves clots, may reduce risk of long-term complications.\n\t* Disadvantages: Increased risk of bleeding, requires close monitoring, and may not be suitable for all patients.\nIn summary, the choice of anticoagulant for initial VTE treatment in adults with cancer depends on various factors, and each option has its advantages and disadvantages. It's essential to consider individual patient needs and weigh the benefits and risks of each treatment carefully.",

Moreover, based on low\u2010 to moderate\u2010certainty evidence, there is little to no difference in major or minor bleeding when comparing fondaparinux with heparin or dalteparin with tinzaparin.

Warfarin:\n\t* Advantages:\n\t\t+ Effective for long-term treatment and prevention of VTE recurrence.\n\t\t+ Reversible, with a known antidote (vitamin K) in case of bleeding complications.\n\t* Disadvantages:\n\t\t+ Requires frequent monitoring and dose adjustments.\n\t\t+ Interacts with many medications and foods, which can affect its efficacy and increase bleeding risk.\n\t\t+ Has a higher risk of bleeding complications compared to some newer anticoagulants.\n2. Low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs):\n\t* Advantages:\n\t\t+ Effective for short-term treatment and prevention of VTE recurrence.\n\t\t+ Have a lower risk of bleeding complications compared to warfarin.\n\t\t+ Do not require frequent monitoring or dose adjustments.\n\t* Disadvantages:\n\t\t+ Require subcutaneous injections, which may be inconvenient for some patients.\n\t\t+ More expensive than warfarin.\n\t\t+ May have a higher risk of thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) in some patients.\n3. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs):\n\t* Advantages:\n\t\t+ Effective for short-term and long-term treatment and prevention of VTE recurrence.\n\t\t+ Have a lower risk of bleeding complications compared to warfarin.\n\t\t+ Do not require frequent monitoring or dose adjustments.\n\t\t+ Oral administration, which may be more convenient for some patients.\n\t* Disadvantages:\n\t\t+ More expensive than warfarin.\n\t\t+ May have a higher risk of gastrointestinal bleeding compared to LM",

            "gold_answer": "Ibuprofen may be more effective in reducing rates of persistent PDA and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) among infants but may be associated with higher rates of oliguria and gastrointestinal hemorrhage when compared with placebo/no treatment; no firm conclusions could be drawn when ibuprofen was compared with indomethacin. When ibuprofen was compared with placebo/no intervention, moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that fewer infants who received ibuprofen had persistent PDA on the third or fourth day of life (154 vs 400 per 1000 infants; all results on average). Similarly, fewer infants who received ibuprofen required surgical closure of PDA (22 vs 48 per 1000 infants) or developed grade III or IV IVH during hospital stay (57 vs 86 per 1000 infants). However, no clear differences in mortality were observed (at < 28 days of life [6 RCTs, 342 infants] nor during hospital stay [4 RCTs, 700 infants]). Reviewers found no clear differences between groups in the rate of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC; moderate\u2010certainty evidence) or chronic lung disease (6 RCTs, 858 infants), but low\u2010certainty evidence suggests possibly higher risk of gastrointestinal hemorrhage during hospital stay among infants given ibuprofen (66 vs 32 per 1000 infants). High\u2010certainty evidence shows that more infants who received ibuprofen had oliguria (208 vs 143 per 1000 infants), rates of severe oliguria (urine output of < 1.0 mg/kg/hour) appeared similar between infants given ibuprofen and placebo (3 RCTs, 332 infants). Infants with ibuprofen also appeared to have higher serum creatinine during treatment (mean difference of around 0.09 mg/dL), as suggested by low\u2010certainty evidence. A further single study with 62 infants compared ibuprofen with indomethacin. The analyses of the trial were underpowered, and no clear differences were shown between groups in all the outcomes evaluated, including the presence of PDA on third or fourth day of life, neonatal mortality, grade III or IV IVH, NEC and gastrointestinal hemorrhage, while the need for surgical closure of PDA, chronic lung disease incidence, oliguria, and serum creatinine levels were not assessed.",

            "llm_answer": "Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that has been used to prevent patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm and/or low birth weight infants. The benefits of using ibuprofen for this purpose include:\n* Effective in closing PDA: Ibuprofen has been shown to be effective in closing PDA in preterm and/or low birth weight infants, which can help prevent complications such as respiratory distress, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and intraventricular hemorrhage.\n* Reduces need for surgical ligation: By closing PDA, ibuprofen can reduce the need for surgical ligation, which can be associated with risks and complications.\n* Fewer side effects than other treatments: Ibuprofen has fewer side effects compared to other treatments for PDA, such as indomethacin, which can cause gastrointestinal and renal problems.\nHowever, there are also potential harms associated with the use of ibuprofen for preventing PDA in preterm and/or low birth weight infants, including:\n* Gastrointestinal upset: Ibuprofen can cause gastrointestinal upset, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.\n* Renal impairment: Ibuprofen can affect renal function, particularly in premature infants who may have immature kidneys.\n* Increased risk of bleeding: Ibuprofen can increase the risk of bleeding, particularly in infants who may have a patent ductus arteriosus that is not ready to close.\n* Uncertain long-term effects: The long-term effects of ibuprofen use in preterm and/or low birth weight infants are not well understood, and there is concern about potential effects on renal and cardiovascular development.\nOverall, the benefits and harms of using ibuprofen for preventing PDA in preterm and/or low birth weight infants must be carefully weighed on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the individual infant's medical history, clinical condition",

            "gold_answer": "Ibuprofen may be more effective in reducing rates of persistent PDA and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) among infants but may be associated with higher rates of oliguria and gastrointestinal hemorrhage when compared with placebo/no treatment; no firm conclusions could be drawn when ibuprofen was compared with indomethacin. When ibuprofen was compared with placebo/no intervention, moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that fewer infants who received ibuprofen had persistent PDA on the third or fourth day of life (154 vs 400 per 1000 infants; all results on average). Similarly, fewer infants who received ibuprofen required surgical closure of PDA (22 vs 48 per 1000 infants) or developed grade III or IV IVH during hospital stay (57 vs 86 per 1000 infants). However, no clear differences in mortality were observed (at < 28 days of life [6 RCTs, 342 infants] nor during hospital stay [4 RCTs, 700 infants]). Reviewers found no clear differences between groups in the rate of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC; moderate\u2010certainty evidence) or chronic lung disease (6 RCTs, 858 infants), but low\u2010certainty evidence suggests possibly higher risk of gastrointestinal hemorrhage during hospital stay among infants given ibuprofen (66 vs 32 per 1000 infants). High\u2010certainty evidence shows that more infants who received ibuprofen had oliguria (208 vs 143 per 1000 infants), rates of severe oliguria (urine output of < 1.0 mg/kg/hour) appeared similar between infants given ibuprofen and placebo (3 RCTs, 332 infants). Infants with ibuprofen also appeared to have higher serum creatinine during treatment (mean difference of around 0.09 mg/dL), as suggested by low\u2010certainty evidence. A further single study with 62 infants compared ibuprofen with indomethacin. The analyses of the trial were underpowered, and no clear differences were shown between groups in all the outcomes evaluated, including the presence of PDA on third or fourth day of life, neonatal mortality, grade III or IV IVH, NEC and gastrointestinal hemorrhage, while the need for surgical closure of PDA, chronic lung disease incidence, oliguria, and serum creatinine levels were not assessed.",

Moderate\u2010quality evidence showed that this benefit was not sustained in the longer\u2010term (5 years). Low\u2010quality evidence suggests there was no benefit of an adjunctive corticosteroid in terms of reducing rates of disabling neurological deficit, ether within 24 months or at 5 years. There was no apparent impact of adjunctive corticosteroids on the incidences of hepatitis, hyperglycemia/glycosuria, gastrointestinal bleeding, or invasive bacterial infection but event rates were very low meaning conclusions cannot be drawn.",

Studies have consistently demonstrated that corticosteroids reduce the risk of death and disability in patients with tuberculous meningitis, particularly in those with severe disease. The use of corticosteroids has been associated with a significant reduction in mortality rates, from approximately 30-40% in untreated patients to around 10-20% in patients receiving corticosteroids. Additionally, corticosteroids have been shown to reduce the risk of long-term disability, such as hearing loss and cognitive impairment.

Moderate\u2010quality evidence showed that this benefit was not sustained in the longer\u2010term (5 years). Low\u2010quality evidence suggests there was no benefit of an adjunctive corticosteroid in terms of reducing rates of disabling neurological deficit, ether within 24 months or at 5 years. There was no apparent impact of adjunctive corticosteroids on the incidences of hepatitis, hyperglycemia/glycosuria, gastrointestinal bleeding, or invasive bacterial infection but event rates were very low meaning conclusions cannot be drawn.",

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers found no conclusive RCT evidence suggesting that administration of probiotics to pregnant women was superior or inferior to placebo in reducing morbidity or mortality in preterm infants. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that in pregnant women who received probiotics, the risk of preterm birth (< 37 weeks) and miscarriage/stillbirth was no more or less likely compared with those who did not receive probiotics. Only one RCT (159 infants) reported no incidences of early neonatal sepsis (\u2264 3 days) in either trial arm. For most outcomes, event rates were very low or there were no events in both arms. There is a lack of data on neonatal short\u2010term (early or late sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, neonatal death, hospital stay) and long\u2010term (major neurodevelopmental disability) potential benefits or harms following probiotic administration. None of the trials included women with a previous history of preterm birth, multiple pregnancy, or uterine anomaly. Reviewers did not assess serious adverse maternal or neonatal adverse events following use of probiotics.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "RCT (rct): A study which tests the effectiveness and safety of treatments or procedures as fairly and objectively as possible. By randomly assigning patients to different treatments for the same problem, the results can be assessed equally with the aim of discovering the best possible procedure for the condition.\nPLACEBO (placebo): an inactive substance; a pill/liquid that contains no medicine\nMORBIDITY (morbidity): undesired result or complication\nMORTALITY (mortality): death\nRISK (risk): The chance that an activity or hazard will give rise to harm. Risk is generally given in terms of numerical odds (1 in 10) or percentages (10%).\nSEPSIS (sepsis): The immune system's overreaction to an infection or injury which can lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and death.\nPOTENTIAL (potential): possible\nPOTENTIATE (potentiate): increase or multiply the effect of a drug or toxin (poison) by giving another drug or toxin at the same time (sometimes an unintentional result)\nPOTENTIATOR (potentiator): an agent that helps another agent work better\nASSESS (assess): to learn about, measure, evaluate, look at",

            "llm_answer": "Yes, probiotics administered to pregnant women have been shown to help prevent morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that can help maintain a healthy gut microbiome, which is important for the development and function of various bodily systems, including the immune system.\nStudies have found that probiotics can help reduce the risk of preterm birth, which is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Probiotics have also been shown to reduce the risk of other complications in preterm infants, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious condition that can cause damage to the intestines.\nIt's important to note that not all probiotics are the same, and some strains have been found to be more effective than others in preventing morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. For example, the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any supplements during pregnancy, including probiotics, to ensure safety and effectiveness. Additionally, it's important to note that while probiotics can help reduce the risk of complications, they are not a guarantee against them, and other factors such as proper prenatal care, a healthy diet, and a safe delivery are also important for a healthy pregnancy and baby.",
