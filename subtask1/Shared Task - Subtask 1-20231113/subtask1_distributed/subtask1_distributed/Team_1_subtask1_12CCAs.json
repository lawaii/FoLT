            "gold_answer": "Low\u2010 to moderate\u2010certainty evidence suggests that clinicians may consider ocrelizumab as an effective and safe treatment option for adults with relapsing\u2010remitting multiple sclerosis. People with relapsing\u2010remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) experience flare\u2010ups of symptoms. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that likely fewer people with RRMS who received ocrelizumab 600 mg by intravenous infusion every 24 weeks experienced at least one relapse by 96 weeks compared with those who received interferon beta\u20101a 44 \u03bcg subcutaneously 3 times weekly (206 vs 335 per 1000 people; all results on average). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that fewer people with RRMS experienced disability progression by 96 weeks with ocrelizumab than with interferon beta\u20101a (69 vs 105 per 1000 people). Based on moderate\u2010 to low\u2010certainty evidence, there was little to no difference in the occurrence of adverse events or serious adverse events between ocrelizumab and interferon beta\u20101a (856 vs 856 per 1000 people and 76 vs 96 per 1000 people, respectively); however, fewer people with RRMS who received ocrelizumab discontinued treatment due to adverse events (35 vs 60 per 1000 people; low\u2010certainty evidence). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that fewer people with RRMS who received ocrelizumab had gadolinium\u2010enhancing T1 lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (98 vs 359 per 1000 people) or new or newly enlarged T2\u2010hyperintense lesions (389 vs 620 per 1000 people). Further low\u2010certainty evidence suggests there was a lower percentage change in brain volume from week 24 to week 96 in people with RRMS who received ocrelizumab compared with interferon beta\u20101a.

            "llm_answer": "Ocrelizumab and interferon beta-1a are both used to treat relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), but they have different mechanisms of action and efficacy profiles. Ocrelizumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets CD20+ B cells, which are involved in the autoimmune response that underlies MS. Interferon beta-1a, on the other hand, is a cytokine that modulates the immune response and reduces inflammation.\nHead-to-head studies have shown that ocrelizumab is more effective than interferon beta-1a in reducing the annualized relapse rate (ARR) and the number of new or enlarging lesions on MRI scans. In the ORATORIO study, ocrelizumab reduced the ARR by 46% compared to interferon beta-1a, and in the OPERA study, the reduction was 53%. Additionally, ocrelizumab has been shown to reduce the risk of disability progression, whereas interferon beta-1a has not been shown to have a significant effect on disability progression.\nHowever, ocrelizumab is associated with a higher risk of infections, particularly upper respiratory tract infections, and a higher risk of malignancies, such as breast cancer. Interferon beta-1a is generally well-tolerated, but it can cause injection site reactions and flu-like symptoms.\nIn summary, ocrelizumab is more effective than interferon beta-1a in reducing relapse rates and MRI lesions in RRMS, but it has a different safety profile. The choice between the two drugs depends on individual patient factors, such as disease activity, tolerability, and comorbidities.",

Both medications have been shown to be effective in reducing the frequency and severity of relapses, but they work in different ways and have different side effect profiles.\nOcrelizumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets a protein called CD20, which is found on the surface of certain immune cells called B cells. By targeting CD20, ocrelizumab depletes the number of B cells in the body, which can help reduce inflammation and prevent relapses.\nInterferon beta-1a, on the other hand, is a type of protein that is produced by cells in the body to help fight viral infections. It works by reducing the production of immune cells that are involved in the autoimmune response that occurs in MS.\nStudies have shown that both ocrelizumab and interferon beta-1a can reduce the annualized relapse rate (ARR) in people with RRMS. However, ocrelizumab has been shown to be more effective in reducing the ARR compared to interferon beta-1a. In a clinical trial, ocrelizumab reduced the ARR by 50% compared to 30% for interferon beta-1a.\nIn terms of side effects, ocrelizumab is generally well-tolerated, but it can cause infusion reactions, which are reactions that occur during or after the infusion of the medication. Interferon beta-1a can also cause side effects such as injection site reactions, fatigue, and flu-like symptoms.\nIt's important to note that both medications have their own risks and benefits, and the choice between them should be made on an individual basis, taking into account a person's medical history, lifestyle, and other factors. It's important to discuss the options with a healthcare professional to determine which medication is best for each person.\nIn",

Compared with placebo (4/262 participants received ivacaftor alone) for adolescents and adults with cystic fibrosis (97% homozygous for F508del mutation), moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that tezacaftor (100 mg once daily) plus ivacaftor (150 mg twice daily) for 28 days probably effects greater improvement in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) % predicted, on average by 6.8%; increases the time to first pulmonary exacerbation (researchers did not report median times to exacerbation, making it difficult to quantify the benefit); and slightly improves Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire\u2013Revised (CFQ\u2010R) respiratory domain scores (on average, by 5.1 points). Although researchers reported no clear increase in the incidence of adverse events with tezacaftor\u2010ivacaftor, the small number of participants included in the analyses (up to 527) would preclude a reliable assessment of these events. A cross\u2010over RCT in people heterozygous for the Phe508del mutation and a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mutation associated with residual CFTR function is not included in this review. Compared with placebo, triple therapy with tezacaftor (100 mg once daily), ivacaftor (150 mg twice daily), and elexacaftor (200 mg once daily) for 28 days may lead to greater increases in FEV 1 % predicted (by 14.30% predicted) and improvements in CFQ\u2010R respiratory domain scores (by 20.20 points), along with a decrease in exacerbations requiring antibiotics (54 vs 164 per 1000 people) and in the incidence of serious adverse events (139 vs 209 per 1000 people) for people with F508del /MF (based on 403 participants). Smaller trials also suggest benefit of this triple therapy when compared with tezacaftor plus ivacaftor, but analyses were underpowered, particularly those assessing adverse events (including 107 to 135 participants). Reviewers reported results for a range of other triple therapies (tezacaftor plus ivacaftor plus VX\u2010659 [80 to 400 mg once daily, or 120 mg twice daily] or elexacaftor [50 or 100 mg daily]); however, analyses included only 12 and 34 participants.

LHWs are trained community members who provide health education, support, and referral services to their communities.\nStudies have shown that LHW-led interventions can improve access to mental health care, increase treatment adherence, and reduce symptoms of mental illness. LHWs can also provide culturally appropriate support and stigma reduction, which can be particularly important in low- and middle-income countries where mental illness may be stigmatized.\nA systematic review of 14 studies on LHW-led interventions for mental health in low- and middle-income countries found that 12 of the studies reported positive effects on mental health outcomes, including reduced symptoms of depression and anxiety, improved mental health knowledge, and increased access to care.\nHowever, it is important to note that the effectiveness of LHW-led interventions can vary depending on factors such as the type and intensity of the intervention, the training and support provided to LHWs, and the cultural and social context in which they are implemented.\nOverall, LHW-led interventions have the potential to improve mental health outcomes for adults in low- and middle-income countries, and may be a promising strategy for addressing the mental health treatment gap in these regions.",

Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows likely little to no difference in adverse events, but probably lower direct healthcare costs (on average, USD 128 lower) with electromagnetic\u2010guided placement than with endoscopic\u2010guided placement. No study assessed long\u2010term safety outcomes.",

However, the review noted that the evidence was limited by the quality of the studies and the small number of studies available.\nA more recent randomized controlled trial published in the Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition found that electromagnetic-guided placement was associated with a higher rate of successful placement on the first attempt compared to endoscopic-guided placement (87.5% vs 75.0%). The study also found that the electromagnetic-guided group had a lower risk of complications such as nasal bleeding and tube dislodgment.\nHowever, it is important to note that the choice of placement method may depend on various factors, such as patient factors, operator experience, and availability of equipment. Both methods have their advantages and disadvantages, and the decision should be made on a case-by-case basis.\nIn summary, while the evidence suggests that electromagnetic-guided placement may have a higher success rate and lower complication rate compared to endoscopic-guided placement, the choice of method should be individualized and based on various factors.

            "gold_answer": "A network meta\u2010analysis found that for adults with nausea and vomiting caused by HEC, fosnetupitant + palonosetron are probably better at controlling nausea and vomiting than the combination of aprepitant + granisetron, but the effect is imprecise. The combinations of fosaprepitant + palonosetron and rolapitant + granisetron are probably better at controlling nausea alone, but the effect for the latter combination is imprecise. For MEC, the combination of rolapitant + granisetron reduces vomiting compared to granisetron alone, but probably leads to less improvement in quality of life. Results for other comparisons and outcomes are less certain. For adults with nausea and vomiting caused by HEC, high\u2010 to moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that the combination of fosnetupitant + palonosetron probably reduces vomiting more than aprepitant + granisetron (810 vs 704 per 1000 people; all results on average); is about the same as netupitant + palonosetron and fosaprepitant + granisetron; and is less than rolapitant + granisetron (627 vs 704 per 1000 people), although results did not reach statistical significance. High\u2010 to moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that compared with the combination of aprepitant + granisetron, fosaprepitant + palonosetron, fosnetupitant + palonosetron, and rolapitant + granisetron are probably better at controlling nausea (absolute effect was not estimable); fosaprepitant + granisetron, rolapitant + ondansetron, and netupitant + palonosetron are probably similar; and fosaprepitant + ondansetron, aprepitant + ondansetron, and casopitant + ondansetron are probably worse (90, 116, and 179 fewer people with controlled nausea per 1000 people, respectively). Results for all of these comparisons except fosaprepitant + palonosetron did not reach statistical significance. Low\u2010 to very low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that compared with the combination of aprepitant + granisetron, rolapitant + ondansetron may lead to better quality of life (QoL). All of the available comparisons may lead to fewer serious adverse events and to minimal to no important differences in mortality, but estimations are too imprecise to draw any firm conclusions. For adults with nausea and vomiting caused by MEC, high\u2010certainty evidence shows that compared with granisetron alone, the combination of rolapitant + granisetron reduces vomiting (660 vs 555 per 1000 people), and moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that the combination of rolapitant + granisetron probably leads to less improvement in QoL (674 vs 620 per 1000 people experienced worse QoL). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that aprepitant + palonosetron, netupitant + palonosetron, palonosetron alone, and aprepitant + granisetron may reduce vomiting (161, 139, 33, and 22 more people with controlled vomiting per 1000 people, respectively); azasetron alone may be similar to granisetron alone; and fosaprepitant + ondansetron, aprepitant + ondansetron, casopitant + ondansetron, and ondansetron alone may worse (55, 78, 94, and 122 fewer people with controlled vomiting per 1000 people, respectively). However, none of these combinations reached statistical significance. Compared with granisetron alone, aprepitant + granisetron and rolapitant + granisetron may improve nausea (151 and 34 more people with controlled nausea per 1000 people, respectively), and the combination of rolapitant + granisetron may lead to an increase in serious adverse events (153 vs 176 per 1000 people), although statistical significance was not reached.",

For adults with nausea and vomiting caused by moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC) or highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC), antiemetics can be effective in reducing the severity and duration of nausea and vomiting.\nAccording to the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), antiemetics are typically used in combination with other medications and strategies to prevent nausea and vomiting. The choice of antiemetic medication and the timing of administration depend on the type and severity of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.\nCommonly used antiemetics for MEC and HEC include:\n1. Serotonin receptor antagonists (ondansetron, granisetron, dolasetron)\n2. Dopamine receptor antagonists (metoclopramide)\n3. NK1 receptor antagonists (aprepitant, fosaprepitant)\n4. Corticosteroids (dexamethasone, methylprednisolone)\nStudies have shown that these medications can significantly reduce the incidence and severity of nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing MEC and HEC. However, it's important to note that not all patients will respond to antiemetics, and some may experience side effects such as fatigue, headache, or constipation.\nIt's important to follow the recommended dosing and administration instructions for antiemetics, as well as to monitor for potential side effects. Additionally, patients should be encouraged to drink plenty of fluids and eat small, frequent meals to help prevent dehydration and malnutrition.\nIn summary, antiemetics can be effective in reducing nausea and vomiting caused by MEC and HEC in adults, but it's important to individualize treatment based on patient factors and to monitor for potential side effects.",

            "llm_answer": "PARP inhibitors have been shown to be effective as maintenance therapy for women with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) who have responded to platinum-based chemotherapy. These drugs work by blocking the activity of PARP, an enzyme involved in DNA repair, which is exploited by cancer cells to repair their damaged DNA and continue to grow and divide uncontrollably. By inhibiting PARP, cancer cells are unable to repair DNA damage, leading to an accumulation of DNA damage and ultimately causing cell death.\nThe use of PARP inhibitors as maintenance therapy has been shown to improve progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with EOC. In clinical trials, PARP inhibitors have been shown to delay the progression of cancer by several months and improve survival rates compared to placebo or no treatment. Additionally, PARP inhibitors are generally well-tolerated, with common side effects including fatigue, nausea, and anemia.\nHowever, not all patients with EOC will benefit from PARP inhibitors, and the identification of biomarkers that can predict which patients are most likely to benefit from these drugs is an active area of research.

            "llm_answer": "PARP inhibitors are a class of drugs that work by blocking the activity of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), an enzyme that plays a role in DNA repair and programmed cell death (apoptosis). Inhibition of PARP can help to prevent cancer cells from repairing their damaged DNA, leading to an accumulation of DNA damage and ultimately causing cell death.\nAs maintenance therapy for women with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), PARP inhibitors have been shown to have several effects, including:\n1. Improved progression-free survival (PFS): PARP inhibitors have been shown to significantly improve PFS in women with advanced EOC, particularly in those who have a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation.\n2. Reduced risk of disease progression: By inhibiting PARP, cancer cells are unable to repair DNA damage, leading to an accumulation of DNA damage and ultimately causing cell death, which can reduce the risk of disease progression.\n3. Improved overall survival: Some studies have suggested that PARP inhibitors may improve overall survival in women with advanced EOC, particularly in those with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation.\n4. Managed side effects: PARP inhibitors can cause side effects such as nausea, fatigue, and anemia, but these are generally manageable and can be minimized with proper dosing and supportive care.\nIt is important to note that PARP inhibitors are not effective in all patients with advanced EOC, and their use is generally limited to those with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. Additionally, PARP inhibitors are not a cure for EOC, and they are typically used in combination with other treatments, such as chemotherapy and surgery, to achieve the best possible outcomes.",

CPAP plus best supportive care did not decrease cardiovascular mortality and had no effect on all\u2010cause mortality. No adverse events were reported in the CPAP group. No trials reported on quality of sleep or quality of life. Reviewers reported that time to life\u2010saving cardiovascular intervention was longer with CPAP; however, mean times were not stated. In the same population, moderate\u2010certainly evidence shows that ASV plus best supportive care probably increases cardiovascular mortality at up to 80 months' follow\u2010up when compared with best supportive care alone. There was little to no difference in quality of life between groups. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that ASV plus best supportive care may provide better improvement in AHI and may decrease all\u2010cause mortality after one year (on average, 165 vs 293 per 1000 people), although the analysis was not statistically significant.",

CPAP plus best supportive care did not decrease cardiovascular mortality and had no effect on all\u2010cause mortality. No adverse events were reported in the CPAP group. No trials reported on quality of sleep or quality of life. Reviewers reported that time to life\u2010saving cardiovascular intervention was longer with CPAP; however, mean times were not stated. In the same population, moderate\u2010certainly evidence shows that ASV plus best supportive care probably increases cardiovascular mortality at up to 80 months' follow\u2010up when compared with best supportive care alone. There was little to no difference in quality of life between groups. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that ASV plus best supportive care may provide better improvement in AHI and may decrease all\u2010cause mortality after one year (on average, 165 vs 293 per 1000 people), although the analysis was not statistically significant.",

            "llm_answer": "Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and adaptive servo ventilation (ASV) are two common treatments for central sleep apnea (CSA) associated with chronic heart failure (CHF).\nCPAP is a machine that delivers a constant flow of air pressure into the airways through a mask worn while sleeping. This pressure helps keep the airways open, preventing apneas and improving sleep quality. Studies have shown that CPAP can improve symptoms such as fatigue, sleepiness, and quality of life in patients with CSA and CHF. However, it may not necessarily improve cardiovascular outcomes such as heart failure symptoms or mortality.\nASV, on the other hand, is a more advanced device that uses sensors to monitor breathing patterns and deliver air pressure in real-time, adapting to the individual's needs. Like CPAP, ASV has been shown to improve sleep quality and reduce daytime sleepiness in patients with CSA and CHF. However, a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies found that ASV may be more effective than CPAP in reducing apneas and improving cardiovascular outcomes, such as blood pressure and heart rate, in patients with CSA and CHF.\nIt's important to note that both CPAP and ASV require proper titration, which is the process of adjusting the pressure and other settings to ensure the device is working effectively and comfortably for the individual.\nIt's also important to note that these treatments should only be prescribed and monitored by a healthcare professional, as they can have side effects and may interact with other medications or health conditions.\nIn summary, both CPAP and ASV can be effective treatments for central sleep apnea associated with chronic heart failure, but ASV may have a slight advantage in improving cardiovascular outcomes. However, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the best course of treatment for each individual case.",

            "gold_answer": "In adults with bipolar I disorder, moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that recurrence of any manic episodes at one year using the assessor's judgment was probably lower with lithium than with lamotrigine (83 vs 176 per 1000 people; all results on average); however, evidence based on the Young Mania Rating Scale was very uncertain. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that there was probably little to no difference between the two agents in the recurrence of depressive episodes at one year based on the assessor's judgment, although the certainty of the evidence for the Montgomery\u2010Asberg Depression Rating Scale was low for this outcome. There was probably little to no difference between lamotrigine and lithium in terms of clinical worsening of people that would require additional psychotropics (i.e. mood stabilizers, antidepressants, antipsychotics, or benzodiazepines) or in withdrawal of either agent for any reason at 6 to 12 months follow\u2010up. Results on active suicidal behavior at one year were very uncertain. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that it is likely that fewer participants experienced adverse effects with lamotrigine than with lithium (139 vs 200 per 1000 people). No data were reported on hospitalization for any mood episodes, quality of life, depression and mania symptom scores, withdrawals due to adverse effects, or adverse effects up to 12 weeks in the studies.",

Lamotrigine, a sodium channel blocker, is thought to stabilize mood by regulating the release of neurotransmitters, while lithium, a mood stabilizer, works by altering the activity of certain neurotransmitters.\nStudies have shown that both drugs are effective for preventing relapses of mania and depression in bipolar disorder, but lamotrigine may have a more favorable side effect profile, with fewer instances of weight gain, tremors, and excessive thirst compared to lithium. However, lamotrigine may be less effective for acute mania and may require longer titration periods to achieve therapeutic effects.\nUltimately, the choice between lamotrigine and lithium for maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder depends on individual patient factors, such as tolerability, efficacy, and comorbidities.

            "gold_answer": "In adults with bipolar I disorder, moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that recurrence of any manic episodes at one year using the assessor's judgment was probably lower with lithium than with lamotrigine (83 vs 176 per 1000 people; all results on average); however, evidence based on the Young Mania Rating Scale was very uncertain. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that there was probably little to no difference between the two agents in the recurrence of depressive episodes at one year based on the assessor's judgment, although the certainty of the evidence for the Montgomery\u2010Asberg Depression Rating Scale was low for this outcome. There was probably little to no difference between lamotrigine and lithium in terms of clinical worsening of people that would require additional psychotropics (i.e. mood stabilizers, antidepressants, antipsychotics, or benzodiazepines) or in withdrawal of either agent for any reason at 6 to 12 months follow\u2010up. Results on active suicidal behavior at one year were very uncertain. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that it is likely that fewer participants experienced adverse effects with lamotrigine than with lithium (139 vs 200 per 1000 people). No data were reported on hospitalization for any mood episodes, quality of life, depression and mania symptom scores, withdrawals due to adverse effects, or adverse effects up to 12 weeks in the studies.",

            "llm_answer": "Lamotrigine and lithium are both commonly used medications for the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. Both drugs have been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of recurrent mood episodes in patients with bipolar disorder. However, they have some differences in terms of their mechanisms of action, side effect profiles, and dosing schedules.\nLamotrigine, also known as lamotrigine, is an anticonvulsant medication that works by stabilizing the activity of certain neurotransmitters in the brain, such as sodium and calcium channels. It is thought to have a mood-stabilizing effect by reducing the release of excitatory neurotransmitters during manic episodes and increasing the release of inhibitory neurotransmitters during depressive episodes. Lamotrigine is typically taken once or twice daily, and it may take several weeks to see the full effects of the medication.\nLithium, on the other hand, is a naturally occurring element that has been used for decades to treat bipolar disorder. It works by altering the levels of certain neurotransmitters in the brain, such as serotonin and dopamine, which helps to regulate mood. Lithium is typically taken once or twice daily, and it may take several weeks to see the full effects of the medication.\nIn terms of efficacy, both medications have been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of recurrent mood episodes in patients with bipolar disorder. However, some studies suggest that lamotrigine may be more effective in preventing depressive episodes, while lithium may be more effective in preventing manic episodes.\nIn terms of side effects, lamotrigine is generally better tolerated than lithium. Common side effects of lamotrigine include dizziness, headache, and fatigue, while common side effects of lithium include weight gain, increased thirst, and hand tremors. However, lamotrigine can cause a rare but serious side effect called Stevens-Johnson syndrome, which is a severe allergic reaction that can be life-threatening.\nIn conclusion, both lamotrigine and lithium are",

            "gold_answer": "For adults with previous esophageal variceal bleeding due to decompensated liver cirrhosis, network meta\u2010analyses (NMAs) suggest sclerotherapy plus nitrates had the lowest mortality, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) and portocaval shunt the lowest incidence of variceal bleeds, sclerotherapy alone or with beta blockers the fewest other decompensation events, and TIPS the fewest adverse events. However, not all active treatments were included in all NMAs, and results of most pairwise comparisons were too imprecise to suggest the presence or absence of benefit of one active treatment over another. Reviewers performed NMAs comparing active interventions for adults with previous esophageal variceal bleeding due to decompensated liver cirrhosis. Sclerotherapy/nitrates had lower mortality (42 per 1000 people; all results on average) than sclerotherapy (225 per 1000 people; used as the reference treatment for calculating absolute values), beta blockers alone (197 per 1000 people), variceal band ligation (213 per 1000 people), TIPS (212 per 1000 people), beta blockers/nitrates (204 per 1000 people), or portocaval shunt (273 per 1000 people). TIPS and portocaval shunt had the lowest incidence of variceal bleeds (87 and 98 per 1000 people, respectively) \u2010 substantially lower than sclerotherapy (473 per 1000 people), beta blockers (767 per 1000 people), variceal band ligation (760 per 1000 people), beta blockers/nitrates (1000 per 1000 people), or variceal band ligation (864 per 1000 people). Sclerotherapy, alone or with beta blockers, had fewer other decompensation events (liver failure, hepatic encephalopathy, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis secondary to ascites; 292 and 131 per 1000 people, respectively) than beta blockers (701 per 1000 people) or TIPS (661 per 1000 people). TIPS was associated with fewer adverse events compared with all seven other active treatments included in the NMA (when absolute numbers reported, 12 vs 194 to 994 per 1000 people). Beta blockers/nitrates/variceal band ligation was associated with more adverse events compared with all seven other treatments. Adverse events were less commonly associated with sclerotherapy, variceal band ligation, and beta blockers/sclerotherapy than beta blockers/nitrates; with sclerotherapy and variceal band ligation than beta blockers; and with variceal band ligation than sclerotherapy/variceal band ligation. NMAs yielded results too imprecise to suggest the presence or absence of benefit of one active treatment over another for other pairwise comparisons reporting these outcomes and for all pairwise comparisons reporting liver transplant and symptomatic variceal rebleed. Only four treatments were included in the NMA for serious adverse events. Reviewers did not assess quality of life.",

EVL vs. drug therapy (e.g., beta-blockers, nitrates, and antacids): EVL is more effective in preventing recurrent bleeding, but drug therapy may be less invasive and have fewer complications.\n3. EVL vs. shunt surgery: EVL is associated with a lower risk of recurrent bleeding and mortality compared to shunt surgery, but shunt surgery may be considered for patients with advanced liver disease and portal hypertension.\n4. EVL vs. radiofrequency ablation: EVL is more effective in preventing recurrent bleeding, but radiofrequency ablation may be associated with fewer complications and a lower risk of variceal rebleeding.\n5. EVL vs. banding ligation: EVL is more effective in preventing recurrent bleeding and reducing the risk of variceal rebleeding, but banding ligation may be less invasive and have fewer complications.\nIt's important to note that the choice of intervention depends on various factors, such as the patient's overall health, liver function, and the presence of other comorbidities.

            "gold_answer": "For adults with previous esophageal variceal bleeding due to decompensated liver cirrhosis, network meta\u2010analyses (NMAs) suggest sclerotherapy plus nitrates had the lowest mortality, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) and portocaval shunt the lowest incidence of variceal bleeds, sclerotherapy alone or with beta blockers the fewest other decompensation events, and TIPS the fewest adverse events. However, not all active treatments were included in all NMAs, and results of most pairwise comparisons were too imprecise to suggest the presence or absence of benefit of one active treatment over another. Reviewers performed NMAs comparing active interventions for adults with previous esophageal variceal bleeding due to decompensated liver cirrhosis. Sclerotherapy/nitrates had lower mortality (42 per 1000 people; all results on average) than sclerotherapy (225 per 1000 people; used as the reference treatment for calculating absolute values), beta blockers alone (197 per 1000 people), variceal band ligation (213 per 1000 people), TIPS (212 per 1000 people), beta blockers/nitrates (204 per 1000 people), or portocaval shunt (273 per 1000 people). TIPS and portocaval shunt had the lowest incidence of variceal bleeds (87 and 98 per 1000 people, respectively) \u2010 substantially lower than sclerotherapy (473 per 1000 people), beta blockers (767 per 1000 people), variceal band ligation (760 per 1000 people), beta blockers/nitrates (1000 per 1000 people), or variceal band ligation (864 per 1000 people). Sclerotherapy, alone or with beta blockers, had fewer other decompensation events (liver failure, hepatic encephalopathy, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis secondary to ascites; 292 and 131 per 1000 people, respectively) than beta blockers (701 per 1000 people) or TIPS (661 per 1000 people). TIPS was associated with fewer adverse events compared with all seven other active treatments included in the NMA (when absolute numbers reported, 12 vs 194 to 994 per 1000 people). Beta blockers/nitrates/variceal band ligation was associated with more adverse events compared with all seven other treatments. Adverse events were less commonly associated with sclerotherapy, variceal band ligation, and beta blockers/sclerotherapy than beta blockers/nitrates; with sclerotherapy and variceal band ligation than beta blockers; and with variceal band ligation than sclerotherapy/variceal band ligation. NMAs yielded results too imprecise to suggest the presence or absence of benefit of one active treatment over another for other pairwise comparisons reporting these outcomes and for all pairwise comparisons reporting liver transplant and symptomatic variceal rebleed. Only four treatments were included in the NMA for serious adverse events. Reviewers did not assess quality of life.",

Endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL): This is a minimally invasive procedure that involves ligating (tying off) the varices using an endoscope. EVL has been shown to have a lower risk of bleeding recurrence compared to other treatments.\n2. Endoscopic variceal injection sclerotherapy (EVIS): This is a similar procedure to EVL, but instead of ligating the varices, a sclerosing agent is injected into the varices to cause them to scar and shrink.\n3. Balloon tamponade: This is a temporary measure to control bleeding, where a balloon is inserted through an endoscope and inflated to compress the varices.\n4. Surgical shunt surgery: This is a surgical procedure that creates a new connection between the portal vein and another vein to reduce pressure in the portal vein and prevent bleeding.\n5. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS): This is a minimally invasive procedure that creates a new connection between the portal vein and the hepatic vein using a small tube. TIPS is usually recommended for patients with severe bleeding that cannot be controlled by other treatments.\nIt's important to note that the choice of intervention depends on the severity and location of the bleeding, as well as the patient's overall health status.

Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that can help maintain a healthy gut microbiome, which is important for the development and function of various bodily systems, including the immune system.\nStudies have found that probiotics can help reduce the risk of preterm birth, which is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Probiotics have also been shown to reduce the risk of other complications in preterm infants, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious condition that can cause damage to the intestines.\nIt's important to note that not all probiotics are the same, and some strains have been found to be more effective than others in preventing morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. For example, the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any supplements during pregnancy, including probiotics, to ensure safety and effectiveness. Additionally, it's important to note that while probiotics can help reduce the risk of complications, they are not a guarantee against them, and other factors such as proper prenatal care, a healthy diet, and a safe delivery are also important for a healthy pregnancy and baby.",
