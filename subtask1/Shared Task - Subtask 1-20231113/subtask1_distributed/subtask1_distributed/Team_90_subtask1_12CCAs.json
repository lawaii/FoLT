Reporting of adverse effects showed a higher incidence of choroidal neovascularization with laser therapy (mostly when using xenon arc laser), although the certainty of evidence was low. Results for regression of PSR, progression or development of new PSR, or visual loss associated with PSR were very uncertain. No information on quality of life is available. Of note, the included studies were published in 1983, 1991, and 2008. Given the limited available evidence, no firm answer to this clinical question can be provided.",

Reporting of adverse effects showed a higher incidence of choroidal neovascularization with laser therapy (mostly when using xenon arc laser), although the certainty of evidence was low. Results for regression of PSR, progression or development of new PSR, or visual loss associated with PSR were very uncertain. No information on quality of life is available. Of note, the included studies were published in 1983, 1991, and 2008. Given the limited available evidence, no firm answer to this clinical question can be provided.",

            "llm_answer": "Laser therapy is a treatment option for people with sickle cell disease-related proliferative retinopathy, which is a complication that can cause abnormal blood vessel growth in the retina. The benefits of laser therapy for this condition include:\n* Reduced risk of vision loss: Laser therapy can help reduce the risk of vision loss by shrinking abnormal blood vessels and preventing them from bleeding or growing further.\n* Improved vision: In some cases, laser therapy can improve vision by reducing the number of abnormal blood vessels in the retina, which can improve the overall clarity of vision.\n* Minimally invasive: Laser therapy is a minimally invasive treatment, which means it does not require surgical intervention and can be performed in a doctor's office or clinic.\nHowever, there are also potential harms associated with laser therapy for sickle cell disease-related proliferative retinopathy, including:\n* Risk of further damage: Laser therapy can sometimes cause further damage to the retina, particularly if the abnormal blood vessels are close to the macula, the part of the retina responsible for central vision.\n* Increased risk of cataracts: Laser therapy can increase the risk of developing cataracts, a clouding of the lens in the eye that can impair vision.\n* Increased risk of glaucoma: Laser therapy can also increase the risk of developing glaucoma, a condition that can damage the optic nerve and lead to vision loss.\nIt's important to note that laser therapy is not suitable for everyone with sickle cell disease-related proliferative retinopathy, and the decision to undergo treatment should be made on a case-by-case basis with the guidance of an eye care professional. It's also important to follow up with regular eye exams to monitor the progression of the disease and adjust treatment as needed.",

            "gold_answer": "Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing 50, 100, or 150 mg oral cilostazol twice daily suggest benefits of cilostazol over placebo in terms of walking distance (on average, improvement of 26 m in pain\u2010free walking distance [low\u2010certainty evidence] and 40 m in maximum walking distance [very low\u2010certainty evidence]). The ankle\u2010brachial index may be slightly higher with cilostazol (on average, by 0.06), but data were available only for the 100\u2010mg twice\u2010daily dose and were based on 859 participants. Results for incidence of myocardial infarction or stroke, arterial revascularization, and amputation were very imprecise. In terms of adverse events, moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that more people probably would experience headache, diarrhea, abnormal stools, dizziness, and/or palpitations with cilostazol. When cilostazol was compared with pentoxifylline, low\u2010 to very low\u2010certainty evidence yielded imprecise results for effectiveness, but more people may experience an adverse event with cilostazol (headache, abnormal stool, palpitations).",

            "llm_answer": "Cilostazol is a medication that is used to treat intermittent claudication, which is pain or discomfort in the legs that occurs during exercise and is caused by reduced blood flow. Studies have shown that cilostazol can improve walking distance and reduce pain in people with intermittent claudication.\nCompared to pentoxifylline, cilostazol has been shown to be more effective in improving walking distance and reducing pain in people with intermittent claudication. Additionally, cilostazol has been associated with a lower risk of adverse effects compared to pentoxifylline.\nIt's important to note that cilostazol may have a higher risk of bleeding compared to pentoxifylline, especially in people who take other medications that can also increase the risk of bleeding, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or warfarin.\nOverall, cilostazol is a useful treatment option for people with intermittent claudication, and it may be a better choice than pentoxifylline for some individuals, especially those who have had a poor response to pentoxifylline or who have a high risk of adverse effects from pentoxifylline. However, the choice between cilostazol and pentoxifylline ultimately depends on the individual patient and their specific medical needs and history.",

The ankle\u2010brachial index may be slightly higher with cilostazol (on average, by 0.06), but data were available only for the 100\u2010mg twice\u2010daily dose and were based on 859 participants. Results for incidence of myocardial infarction or stroke, arterial revascularization, and amputation were very imprecise. In terms of adverse events, moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that more people probably would experience headache, diarrhea, abnormal stools, dizziness, and/or palpitations with cilostazol. When cilostazol was compared with pentoxifylline, low\u2010 to very low\u2010certainty evidence yielded imprecise results for effectiveness, but more people may experience an adverse event with cilostazol (headache, abnormal stool, palpitations).",

            "llm_answer": "Cilostazol is a medication that is used to treat intermittent claudication, which is a condition characterized by pain or discomfort in the legs when walking or exercising. It works by improving blood flow to the legs and reducing inflammation.\nStudies have shown that cilostazol can improve walking distance and reduce pain in people with intermittent claudication. In a clinical trial, patients who took cilostazol were able to walk an average of 170 meters further than those who took a placebo. Additionally, cilostazol has been shown to improve quality of life and reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in people with intermittent claudication.\nWhen compared to pentoxifylline, another medication used to treat intermittent claudication, cilostazol has been shown to be more effective in improving walking distance and reducing pain. However, both medications have similar side effect profiles and may interact with other medications in a similar way.\nIt's important to note that cilostazol may not be suitable for everyone, especially those with certain medical conditions such as heart disease, liver or kidney disease, or a history of bleeding disorders. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional to determine if cilostazol is appropriate for your specific condition and medical history.\nIn summary, cilostazol is a useful medication for treating intermittent claudication, and it has been shown to be more effective than pentoxifylline in improving walking distance and reducing pain. However, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional to determine if it's appropriate for your specific condition and medical history.",

The results regarding other outcomes and other types of procedures were imprecise. For women with POP and symptomatic SUI, moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that probably fewer women have subjective postoperative SUI after vaginal repair with MUS than with vaginal repair alone (71 vs 234 per 1000 women, all results on average), even for women with occult SUI (199 vs 522 per 1000 women). The same applies when vaginal repair with concomitant MUS was compared with delayed MUS, and probably more women have subjective postoperative SUI with abdominal sacrocolpopexy with Burch colposuspension than with abdominal sacrocolpopexy alone; however, the confidence intervals were also compatible with opposite results. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that probably fewer women require further continence surgery after vaginal repair with MUS than with vaginal repair alone (8 vs 169 per 1000 women), and low\u2010certainty evidence suggests the same effect for women with occult SUI (18 vs 122 per 1000 women). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that fewer women with occult SUI may experience cured or improved overactive bladder symptoms after vaginal repair with MUS than with vaginal repair alone, and moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that probably fewer women cure or improve overactive bladder symptoms with abdominal sacrocolpopexy with or without Burch colposuspension; however, the results were imprecise, and the confidence intervals were also compatible with opposite results. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that there may be minimal to no important difference in voiding dysfunction after vaginal repair with MUS than with vaginal repair alone or with abdominal sacrocolpopexy with or without Burch colposuspension, and moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows likely little to no difference in recurrent POP on examination after vaginal repair with MUS than with vaginal repair alone.

            "llm_answer": "For women with pelvic organ prolapse (POP) and stress urinary incontinence (SUI), continence procedure (also known as urinary incontinence surgery) is a surgical intervention that aims to address both conditions simultaneously. The procedure typically involves repairing the prolapsed pelvic organs and reinforcing the weakened muscles and tissues that cause incontinence.\nCompared to no or delayed continence procedure POP surgery, undergoing continence procedure has several advantages. These include:\n1. Improved symptoms: Continence procedure can significantly improve symptoms of both POP and SUI, reducing the discomfort, inconvenience, and embarrassment associated with these conditions.\n2. Enhanced quality of life: By addressing the root causes of POP and SUI, continence procedure can improve a woman's overall quality of life, allowing her to engage in daily activities with greater confidence and comfort.\n3. Reduced risk of complications: Delaying or forgoing surgery may lead to the progression of POP and SUI, which can result in more severe symptoms, increased discomfort, and a higher risk of complications.\n4. Shorter recovery time: While recovery time varies for each individual, continence procedure typically has a shorter recovery period compared to more invasive surgeries that may be required if POP and SUI are left untreated.\n5. Minimally invasive options: Many continence procedures can be performed using minimally invasive techniques, which reduce the risk of complications and promote faster healing.\n6. Improved sexual function: In some cases, continence procedure can also improve sexual function, which may be affected by POP and SUI.\nIt is essential to note that continence procedure, like any surgery, carries risks and potential side effects. These may include infection, bleeding, and temporary urinary retention. Your healthcare provider can help you understand the specific risks and benefits associated with continence procedure and determine if it is the best course of treatment for your individual case.\nIn summary, for women with POP and SUI, undergoing continence procedure can provide significant improvements in symptoms, quality of life, and overall well-being,",

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers identified moderate\u2010certainty evidence that P4P (such as conditional cash payment, conditional provision of material goods, and target payment) probably has little to no impact on mothers receiving tetanus vaccination (estimated impact 2%) compared with an alternative intervention (predominantly enhanced financing interventions whereby comparator health facilities received funding matched to P4P groups). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that P4P had a positive effect on reporting of childhood illness and utilization of care, as well as on the quality of family planning services, antenatal care, and patient assessment, but little to no impact on the proportion of mothers who breastfed their offspring or on the utilization of immunization more generally, family planning, or antenatal care services. It is worth noting that P4P interventions varied in their methods and in targeted indicators. Consequently, it is difficult to draw any overall conclusions about the benefits of P4P compared to other interventions for improving delivery of health interventions in low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "CONDITION (condition): A state of being, like being healthy or fit, or having a problem, such as a heart problem.\nANTENATAL (antenatal): Before birth.\nASSESS (assess): to learn about, measure, evaluate, look at\nIMMUNITY (immunity): defense against, protection from\nDELIVERY (delivery): Birth of a baby and its afterbirth (see placenta).

            "llm_answer": "Paying for performance (P4P) is a strategy that has been implemented in low- and middle-income countries to improve the delivery of health interventions. P4P programs offer financial incentives to healthcare providers for achieving specific performance targets, such as increased vaccination rates or improved maternal and child health outcomes.\nCompared to alternative interventions, P4P has been shown to be effective in improving health outcomes in low- and middle-income countries. A systematic review of 23 studies found that P4P interventions were associated with significant improvements in health outcomes, including increased vaccination rates, improved maternal and child health outcomes, and increased use of essential medicines.\nP4P has several advantages over alternative interventions. First, it allows for targeted incentives that are linked to specific performance metrics, which can help to focus efforts on areas where improvements are most needed. Second, P4P can help to address issues of provider motivation and effort, as healthcare providers are incentivized to improve their performance in order to receive financial rewards. Finally, P4P can help to increase accountability and transparency, as performance metrics are tracked and reported, which can help to identify areas for improvement and ensure that resources are being used effectively.\nHowever, P4P also has some limitations. One concern is that P4P may not address the root causes of poor health outcomes, such as inadequate infrastructure, lack of trained personnel, or inadequate supply chains. Additionally, P4P may not be effective in settings where healthcare providers are not motivated by financial incentives or where there are significant challenges in measuring performance.\nIn summary, P4P is a promising strategy for improving health outcomes in low- and middle-income countries, but it should be carefully designed and implemented to ensure that it is effective and equitable. It is important to consider the local context and address any underlying barriers to improving health outcomes, and to ensure that P4P is combined with other interventions that address the broader determinants of health.",

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers identified moderate\u2010certainty evidence that P4P (such as conditional cash payment, conditional provision of material goods, and target payment) probably has little to no impact on mothers receiving tetanus vaccination (estimated impact 2%) compared with an alternative intervention (predominantly enhanced financing interventions whereby comparator health facilities received funding matched to P4P groups). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that P4P had a positive effect on reporting of childhood illness and utilization of care, as well as on the quality of family planning services, antenatal care, and patient assessment, but little to no impact on the proportion of mothers who breastfed their offspring or on the utilization of immunization more generally, family planning, or antenatal care services. It is worth noting that P4P interventions varied in their methods and in targeted indicators. Consequently, it is difficult to draw any overall conclusions about the benefits of P4P compared to other interventions for improving delivery of health interventions in low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries.",

            "llm_answer": "Paying for performance (P4P) is a strategy that has been implemented in low- and middle-income countries to improve the delivery of health interventions. P4P programs provide financial incentives to healthcare providers for achieving specific performance targets, such as increased vaccination rates or improved maternal and child health outcomes.\nCompared to alternative interventions, P4P has been shown to be effective in improving health outcomes in low- and middle-income countries. A systematic review of 22 studies found that P4P interventions were associated with significant improvements in health outcomes, including increased vaccination rates, improved maternal and child health outcomes, and increased use of essential medicines.\nP4P has several advantages over alternative interventions. First, it allows for targeted incentives that are directly linked to specific health outcomes, which can lead to more focused efforts to improve those outcomes. Second, P4P can help to address issues of provider motivation and effort, as healthcare providers are incentivized to improve their performance in order to receive financial rewards. Finally, P4P can help to align the interests of healthcare providers with those of patients and policymakers, promoting a more patient-centered approach to care.\nHowever, P4P also has some potential limitations. One concern is that P4P may inadvertently create incentives for healthcare providers to prioritize certain patients or services over others, potentially exacerbating existing health disparities. Additionally, P4P may not address broader systemic issues that can impact health outcomes, such as inadequate infrastructure or supply chain challenges.\nIn summary, P4P is a promising strategy for improving health outcomes in low- and middle-income countries, but it should be carefully designed and implemented to ensure that it is effective and equitable. It is important to consider alternative interventions and to address broader systemic issues in order to maximize the impact of P4P programs.",

            "gold_answer": "For older adults (average age, 52 to 83 years) with no known cognitive syndrome, evidence suggests significant associations between anticholinergic drug use and increased risk of cognitive impairment of any kind, dementia, and cognitive decline. However, 19 of 25 studies were at high risk of bias in at least one domain assessed by reviewers, and no study was at low risk of bias in every domain. The most common issues were lack of control for reverse causation (14 studies), attrition/missing data (9 studies), and generalizability (9 studies). Most studies controlled for age, sex, and comorbidities as covariates, but only 13 of 25 controlled for psychiatric conditions such as depression, which may heighten risk or may even be prodromal signs of dementia, as well as increase anticholinergic burden. In addition, 24 studies were retrospective, and four studies included 95% of the review's 968,428 participants. Reviewers stated that the overall quality of evidence was low, and that the strength of the association between anticholinergic drugs and dementia may have been exaggerated. Consequently, no firm conclusions can be drawn.",

Anticholinergic burden refers to the cumulative effect of medications and other substances that block the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in cognitive function. Studies have shown that higher anticholinergic burden is associated with increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia in older adults.\nA study published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease found that older adults with higher anticholinergic burden had lower cognitive performance and a greater risk of cognitive decline over a two-year period. Another study published in the Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry and Neurology found that anticholinergic burden was a significant predictor of cognitive decline in older adults without dementia.\nIt is important to note that while anticholinergic burden can be a useful tool in predicting cognitive impairment, it is not a definitive diagnostic tool. Other factors such as medical history, lifestyle, and genetics also play a role in cognitive decline. It is essential to consult with a healthcare professional to interpret the results of anticholinergic burden assessment and develop a plan to mitigate the risk of cognitive impairment.",

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers reported three comparisons of different frequencies of home visits in the early postpartum period: home visits versus no home visits; four home visits versus one home visit; and more home visits versus fewer home visits, with both groups receiving more than four visits. When reviewers assessed certainty of the evidence, this was low to very low; most included trials failed to report key methods or reported methods that could introduce bias (such as failure to blind outcome assessors). Clinically relevant outcomes were inconsistently reported across comparisons (maternal and neonatal mortality or morbidity, secondary postpartum hemorrhage, postnatal depression, maternal satisfaction, infant immunization), and no RCTs reported infant failure to thrive or abuse/neglect. Outcomes with evidence suggesting benefit with more rather than fewer visits were: ? exclusive breastfeeding was increased at six weeks and at six months (600 vs 333 and 301 vs 202 per 1000 women, respectively; all results on average) and infant diarrhea was reduced within 42 days (449 vs 527 per 1000 infants) with home visits versus no home visits; ? fewer infants utilized non\u2010prescribed health care (169 vs 408 per 1000 infants) and more women exclusively breastfed for up to six weeks (949 vs 839 per 1000 women) with four home visits versus one home visit; and ? fewer infants utilized non\u2010prescribed health care (74 vs 154 per 1000 infants) and maternal depression and satisfaction scores were better (by approx. 1 point on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale [scale used to assess maternal satisfaction was unclear]) with six to ten visits versus zero or one visit from health visitors or lay supporters, in addition to at least four routine midwife visits. Given the limitations of available data, no firm conclusions can be drawn.",

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers reported three comparisons of different frequencies of home visits in the early postpartum period: home visits versus no home visits; four home visits versus one home visit; and more home visits versus fewer home visits, with both groups receiving more than four visits. When reviewers assessed certainty of the evidence, this was low to very low; most included trials failed to report key methods or reported methods that could introduce bias (such as failure to blind outcome assessors). Clinically relevant outcomes were inconsistently reported across comparisons (maternal and neonatal mortality or morbidity, secondary postpartum hemorrhage, postnatal depression, maternal satisfaction, infant immunization), and no RCTs reported infant failure to thrive or abuse/neglect. Outcomes with evidence suggesting benefit with more rather than fewer visits were: ? exclusive breastfeeding was increased at six weeks and at six months (600 vs 333 and 301 vs 202 per 1000 women, respectively; all results on average) and infant diarrhea was reduced within 42 days (449 vs 527 per 1000 infants) with home visits versus no home visits; ? fewer infants utilized non\u2010prescribed health care (169 vs 408 per 1000 infants) and more women exclusively breastfed for up to six weeks (949 vs 839 per 1000 women) with four home visits versus one home visit; and ? fewer infants utilized non\u2010prescribed health care (74 vs 154 per 1000 infants) and maternal depression and satisfaction scores were better (by approx. 1 point on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale [scale used to assess maternal satisfaction was unclear]) with six to ten visits versus zero or one visit from health visitors or lay supporters, in addition to at least four routine midwife visits. Given the limitations of available data, no firm conclusions can be drawn.",

They can also help improve coping skills, social support, and adherence to treatment.\nSome specific interventions that have been found to be effective include cognitive-behavioral therapy, relaxation techniques, mindfulness-based interventions, and supportive group therapy. These interventions can be delivered individually or in a group setting, and may be led by trained mental health professionals or peer support groups.\nIt's important to note that while psychological interventions can have positive effects, they should not replace medical treatment. Women with non-metastatic breast cancer should discuss their treatment options with their healthcare provider and develop a comprehensive treatment plan that addresses their physical and emotional needs.",

            "llm_answer": "Exercise has been shown to have several benefits for preventing falls in adults with Parkinson's disease. Regular exercise can help improve balance, strength, and flexibility, which are all important for preventing falls. Additionally, exercise can help improve cognitive function and reduce the risk of depression, both of which can also contribute to a reduced risk of falls.\nSome specific types of exercise that may be beneficial for preventing falls in adults with Parkinson's disease include:\n1. Balance training: Exercises that focus on improving balance, such as tai chi or balance training classes, can help individuals with Parkinson's disease improve their ability to maintain their balance and reduce their risk of falls.\n2. Strength training: Resistance training exercises, such as weightlifting or bodyweight exercises, can help improve muscle strength and endurance, which can help individuals with Parkinson's disease maintain their independence and reduce their risk of falls.\n3. Aerobic exercise: Aerobic exercises, such as walking, cycling, or swimming, can help improve cardiovascular health and reduce the risk of falls by improving overall physical fitness.\n4. Functional training: Exercises that mimic daily activities, such as getting up from a chair or walking, can help individuals with Parkinson's disease improve their ability to perform these tasks safely and reduce their risk of falls.\nIt's important to note that it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new exercise program, especially if you have a medical condition such as Parkinson's disease. They can help you determine the most appropriate exercises for your individual needs and abilities, and ensure that you're exercising safely and effectively.",

Moderate\u2010quality evidence showed that this benefit was not sustained in the longer\u2010term (5 years). Low\u2010quality evidence suggests there was no benefit of an adjunctive corticosteroid in terms of reducing rates of disabling neurological deficit, ether within 24 months or at 5 years. There was no apparent impact of adjunctive corticosteroids on the incidences of hepatitis, hyperglycemia/glycosuria, gastrointestinal bleeding, or invasive bacterial infection but event rates were very low meaning conclusions cannot be drawn.",

Studies have consistently demonstrated that corticosteroids reduce the risk of death and disability in patients with tuberculous meningitis, particularly in those with severe disease. The use of corticosteroids has been associated with a significant reduction in mortality rates, from approximately 30-40% in untreated patients to around 10-20% in patients receiving corticosteroids. Additionally, corticosteroids have been shown to reduce the risk of long-term disability, such as hearing loss and cognitive impairment.

Moderate\u2010quality evidence showed that this benefit was not sustained in the longer\u2010term (5 years). Low\u2010quality evidence suggests there was no benefit of an adjunctive corticosteroid in terms of reducing rates of disabling neurological deficit, ether within 24 months or at 5 years. There was no apparent impact of adjunctive corticosteroids on the incidences of hepatitis, hyperglycemia/glycosuria, gastrointestinal bleeding, or invasive bacterial infection but event rates were very low meaning conclusions cannot be drawn.",

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers found no conclusive RCT evidence suggesting that administration of probiotics to pregnant women was superior or inferior to placebo in reducing morbidity or mortality in preterm infants. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that in pregnant women who received probiotics, the risk of preterm birth (< 37 weeks) and miscarriage/stillbirth was no more or less likely compared with those who did not receive probiotics. Only one RCT (159 infants) reported no incidences of early neonatal sepsis (\u2264 3 days) in either trial arm. For most outcomes, event rates were very low or there were no events in both arms. There is a lack of data on neonatal short\u2010term (early or late sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, neonatal death, hospital stay) and long\u2010term (major neurodevelopmental disability) potential benefits or harms following probiotic administration. None of the trials included women with a previous history of preterm birth, multiple pregnancy, or uterine anomaly. Reviewers did not assess serious adverse maternal or neonatal adverse events following use of probiotics.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "RCT (rct): A study which tests the effectiveness and safety of treatments or procedures as fairly and objectively as possible. By randomly assigning patients to different treatments for the same problem, the results can be assessed equally with the aim of discovering the best possible procedure for the condition.\nPLACEBO (placebo): an inactive substance; a pill/liquid that contains no medicine\nMORBIDITY (morbidity): undesired result or complication\nMORTALITY (mortality): death\nRISK (risk): The chance that an activity or hazard will give rise to harm. Risk is generally given in terms of numerical odds (1 in 10) or percentages (10%).\nSEPSIS (sepsis): The immune system's overreaction to an infection or injury which can lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and death.\nPOTENTIAL (potential): possible\nPOTENTIATE (potentiate): increase or multiply the effect of a drug or toxin (poison) by giving another drug or toxin at the same time (sometimes an unintentional result)\nPOTENTIATOR (potentiator): an agent that helps another agent work better\nASSESS (assess): to learn about, measure, evaluate, look at",

            "llm_answer": "Yes, probiotics administered to pregnant women have been shown to help prevent morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that can help maintain a healthy gut microbiome, which is important for the development and function of various bodily systems, including the immune system.\nStudies have found that probiotics can help reduce the risk of preterm birth, which is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Probiotics have also been shown to reduce the risk of other complications in preterm infants, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious condition that can cause damage to the intestines.\nIt's important to note that not all probiotics are the same, and some strains have been found to be more effective than others in preventing morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. For example, the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any supplements during pregnancy, including probiotics, to ensure safety and effectiveness. Additionally, it's important to note that while probiotics can help reduce the risk of complications, they are not a guarantee against them, and other factors such as proper prenatal care, a healthy diet, and a safe delivery are also important for a healthy pregnancy and baby.",
