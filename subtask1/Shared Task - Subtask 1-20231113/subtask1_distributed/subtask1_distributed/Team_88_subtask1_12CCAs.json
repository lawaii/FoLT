            "gold_answer": "Reviewers identified 145 qualitative studies reporting factors that influenced parents' and informal caregivers' views and practices regarding routine childhood vaccination; they selected 27 studies for analysis. With regard to ideas and practices surrounding childhood health and illness, several factors may influence parents' and caregivers' decisions: considering children weak and vulnerable with unique immune systems and individual needs; viewing vaccinations as unnecessary or harmful; and personal choice and responsibility of parents (high\u2010confidence evidence); parental expertise (moderate\u2010confidence evidence) and religious beliefs (low\u2010confidence evidence). Parents' views on vaccination are influenced by social networks (including relatives, peers, neighbors, and others; high\u2010confidence evidence); however, their views also shape these networks (moderate\u2010confidence evidence). Lack of trust in the institutions involved in the vaccination is another factor that may affect parents' decisions, along with marginalization, inadequate public services, and priority misalignment (moderate\u2010confidence evidence). Past and present controversies of authorities and expert systems may be another factor (low\u2010confidence evidence). Finally, socio\u2010economic difficulties in accessing services and interacting with healthcare workers (high\u2010confidence evidence), undesirable features of vaccination services (moderate\u2010confidence evidence), and vaccination perceived as a social event (low\u2010confidence evidence) may contribute. Reviewers described two possible pathways to reduced acceptance of childhood vaccination. On one hand is the fact that parents (most from high\u2010income countries) understand their health and healthcare decisions to be matters of individual risk, choice, and responsibility that are in conflict with vaccination programs. On the other hand, parents (most from low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries) may feel socially excluded, frustrated, and demotivated, which may lead to distrust of authorities and of childhood vaccination. Evidence for both pathways is of moderate confidence.",

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers identified 145 qualitative studies reporting factors that influenced parents' and informal caregivers' views and practices regarding routine childhood vaccination; they selected 27 studies for analysis. With regard to ideas and practices surrounding childhood health and illness, several factors may influence parents' and caregivers' decisions: considering children weak and vulnerable with unique immune systems and individual needs; viewing vaccinations as unnecessary or harmful; and personal choice and responsibility of parents (high\u2010confidence evidence); parental expertise (moderate\u2010confidence evidence) and religious beliefs (low\u2010confidence evidence). Parents' views on vaccination are influenced by social networks (including relatives, peers, neighbors, and others; high\u2010confidence evidence); however, their views also shape these networks (moderate\u2010confidence evidence). Lack of trust in the institutions involved in the vaccination is another factor that may affect parents' decisions, along with marginalization, inadequate public services, and priority misalignment (moderate\u2010confidence evidence). Past and present controversies of authorities and expert systems may be another factor (low\u2010confidence evidence). Finally, socio\u2010economic difficulties in accessing services and interacting with healthcare workers (high\u2010confidence evidence), undesirable features of vaccination services (moderate\u2010confidence evidence), and vaccination perceived as a social event (low\u2010confidence evidence) may contribute. Reviewers described two possible pathways to reduced acceptance of childhood vaccination. On one hand is the fact that parents (most from high\u2010income countries) understand their health and healthcare decisions to be matters of individual risk, choice, and responsibility that are in conflict with vaccination programs. On the other hand, parents (most from low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries) may feel socially excluded, frustrated, and demotivated, which may lead to distrust of authorities and of childhood vaccination. Evidence for both pathways is of moderate confidence.",

Some may have concerns about the safety or effectiveness of vaccines, or may believe that vaccines are not necessary for their child.\n2. Misinformation or misconceptions: There is a lot of misinformation about vaccines on the internet and social media, which can lead to misunderstandings and misconceptions about the risks and benefits of vaccination.\n3. Cultural or religious beliefs: Some cultural or religious beliefs may influence parents' and caregivers' views on vaccination. For example, some beliefs may prohibit the use of certain vaccines or medical interventions.\n4. Personal experience: Parents' and caregivers' personal experiences with vaccines, either themselves or within their family, can shape their views on vaccination. For example, if they have had a negative experience with a vaccine, they may be hesitant to vaccinate their child.\n5. Healthcare provider's recommendation: Healthcare providers play a crucial role in educating parents and caregivers about the importance of vaccination. If a healthcare provider recommends vaccination, it can significantly influence parents' and caregivers' decisions.\n6. Social norms: Parents' and caregivers' social networks and communities can also influence their views on vaccination. If they are surrounded by people who are anti-vaccination, they may be more likely to adopt that view themselves.\n7. Access to information: Access to accurate and reliable information about vaccines and their benefits can also influence parents' and caregivers' views. If they have access to credible sources of information, they are more likely to make informed decisions about vaccination.\n8.

Moderate\u2010certainty evidence also shows that a phlebotonic probably reduces ankle perimeter circumference (by 4.27 mm at 1 to 12 months' follow\u2010up) and the number of people experiencing lower leg cramps (413 vs 576 people per 1000 people), restless legs (504 vs 622 people per 1000 people), and lower limb paresthesia (420 vs 630 people per 1000 people), but more people experience an adverse event (148 vs 130 per 1000 people). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests little to no difference in ulcer healing between phlebotonics and placebo, possibly because ulceration is a late, more severe manifestation of CVI; event rates were lower, making analysis of 461 underpowered; and the duration of follow\u2010up in some trials may not have been sufficient to assess this outcome.",

            "gold_answer": "Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that fewer people with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) (most often moderate and characterized by edema, skin pigmentation, varicose veins, and post\u2010thrombotic syndromes) who were receiving a phlebotonic had lower limb edema compared with those given placebo during one to six months' follow\u2010up (486 vs 692 people per 1000 people; all results on average). Moderate\u2010certainty evidence also shows that a phlebotonic probably reduces ankle perimeter circumference (by 4.27 mm at 1 to 12 months' follow\u2010up) and the number of people experiencing lower leg cramps (413 vs 576 people per 1000 people), restless legs (504 vs 622 people per 1000 people), and lower limb paresthesia (420 vs 630 people per 1000 people), but more people experience an adverse event (148 vs 130 per 1000 people). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests little to no difference in ulcer healing between phlebotonics and placebo, possibly because ulceration is a late, more severe manifestation of CVI; event rates were lower, making analysis of 461 underpowered; and the duration of follow\u2010up in some trials may not have been sufficient to assess this outcome.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "CHRONIC (chronic): continuing for a long time, ongoing\nEDEMA (edema): excess fluid collecting in tissue\nVEIN (vein): A blood vessel that takes blood towards the heart.\nSYNDROME (syndrome): a condition characterized by a set of symptoms\nPLACEBO (placebo): an inactive substance; a pill/liquid that contains no medicine\nASSESS (assess): to learn about, measure, evaluate, look at",

            "llm_answer": "Phlebotonics, also known as venous blood flow agents, are medications that help improve blood flow through the veins. They are commonly used to treat venous insufficiency, which occurs when the veins have difficulty returning blood to the heart due to damaged or weakened valves.\nThe effects of phlebotonics on signs and symptoms of venous insufficiency can include:\n1. Reduced swelling: Phlebotonics can help reduce swelling in the legs and ankles, which is a common symptom of venous insufficiency.\n2. Improved blood flow: By improving blood flow through the veins, phlebotonics can help reduce the risk of blood clots and improve overall circulation.\n3. Relief of pain: Phlebotonics can help relieve pain and discomfort in the legs, which can be a symptom of venous insufficiency.\n4. Improved skin texture: Phlebotonics can help improve the texture and appearance of the skin, which can become dry and itchy due to venous insufficiency.\n5. Reduced risk of complications: By improving blood flow and reducing swelling, phlebotonics can help reduce the risk of complications such as skin ulcers and infections.\nIt's important to note that phlebotonics are not a cure for venous insufficiency, and they may not completely eliminate all symptoms. It's also important to follow a healthcare professional's instructions when taking these medications and to wear compression stockings as recommended to help improve blood flow and reduce swelling.",

Osteoporosis: Steroids can lead to bone thinning and increased risk of fractures.\n2. Adrenal insufficiency: Prolonged use of steroids can suppress the adrenal glands, leading to a decrease in natural cortisol production.\n3. Increased risk of infections: Steroids can suppress the immune system, making patients more susceptible to infections.\n4. Mood changes: Steroids can cause mood swings, anxiety, and depression.\n5. Weight gain: Steroids can cause fat redistribution and weight gain, particularly in the face, neck, and abdomen.\n6. Skin changes: Steroids can cause acne, thinning of the skin, and purple striae (stretch marks).\n7. Eye problems: Steroids can cause cataracts and glaucoma.\n8. Increased risk of cardiovascular disease: Steroids can increase blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and risk of heart disease.\n9. Increased risk of diabetes: Steroids can increase blood sugar levels and risk of developing diabetes.\n10. Negative impact on fertility: Steroids can affect fertility in both men and women.\nIt is important to note that not all patients who take oral steroids for cystic fibrosis will experience these side effects, and the severity of the side effects can vary from person to person. However, it is important to be aware of these potential effects and to discuss any concerns with a healthcare provider.",

            "llm_answer": "Long-term use of oral steroids for cystic fibrosis can have several potential effects, including:\n1. Improved lung function: Oral steroids, such as prednisone, can help reduce inflammation in the lungs and improve lung function in people with cystic fibrosis.\n2. Reduced frequency of lung infections: Steroids can help reduce the frequency of lung infections, such as bronchitis and pneumonia, which are common complications of cystic fibrosis.\n3. Improved weight gain: Steroids can help increase appetite and promote weight gain, which is important for people with cystic fibrosis who may have difficulty gaining weight due to their condition.\n4. Improved bone density: Steroids can help improve bone density, which can reduce the risk of osteoporosis and fractures.\n5. Increased risk of side effects: Long-term use of oral steroids can increase the risk of side effects such as cataracts, glaucoma, and osteoporosis.\n6. Increased risk of infections: Long-term use of steroids can increase the risk of infections, such as thrush, and can also mask the symptoms of infections, making it difficult to diagnose them.\n7. Adrenal gland suppression: Long-term use of steroids can suppress the adrenal glands, which can lead to a decrease in the production of hormones that regulate the body's response to stress.\n8. Mood changes: Steroids can cause mood changes, such as anxiety, irritability, and mood swings.\n9. Stunted growth: Long-term use of steroids in children and adolescents can stunt growth.\nIt's important to note that the benefits and risks of long-term oral steroid use for cystic fibrosis can vary depending on the individual, and the decision to use steroids should be made on a case-by-case basis with the guidance of a healthcare professional.",

The preferred diagnostic approach is a combination of imaging modalities, such as ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), along with biomarkers like AFP and des-gamma-carboxyprothrombin (DCP).

            "llm_answer": "Abdominal ultrasound and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) testing can be useful tools in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) for adults with chronic liver disease, but their accuracy varies depending on the specific circumstances.\nAbdominal ultrasound can help identify liver lesions that may be indicative of HCC, but its sensitivity and specificity are limited. The sensitivity of ultrasound for detecting HCC can range from 40-80%, with a specificity of 80-90% (1). However, ultrasound may not be able to detect small tumors or those that are located in certain areas of the liver.\nAFP testing can also be used as a diagnostic tool for HCC, as elevated levels of AFP in the blood can be indicative of liver cancer. However, AFP levels can also be elevated in other conditions, such as liver cirrhosis, hepatitis, and benign liver tumors, which can limit its specificity (2). The sensitivity and specificity of AFP testing for HCC are generally lower than those of ultrasound, with a sensitivity ranging from 30-80% and a specificity of 70-90% (3).\nTherefore, while both abdominal ultrasound and AFP testing can be useful in the diagnosis of HCC for adults with chronic liver disease, their accuracy is not ideal, and they should be used in combination with other diagnostic tools, such as biomarkers, imaging studies, and liver biopsy, to achieve a more accurate diagnosis. It is important for healthcare providers to carefully evaluate the patient's individual circumstances and use a combination of diagnostic tests to make an accurate diagnosis and develop an appropriate treatment plan.\nReferences:\n1.

            "gold_answer": "Although ataluren may improve lung function for people with cystic fibrosis with a nonsense mutation, these improvements are not clinically significant. Given the apparent lack of clinical benefit, ataluren does not have marketing authorization for this indication in the UK or the USA. Reviewers identified two RCTs with 517 people aged 6 to 53 years (mean 23 years) and 52% male with cystic fibrosis with a nonsense mutation in at least one allele of the CFTR gene that compared ataluren (40 mg/kg/d in divided doses) with placebo. Overall, ataluren led to a slightly greater increase in % predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV?) (on average, by 1.5% to 3.5% at six time points across 8 to 48 weeks); only the result at 8 weeks reached statistical significance, but increases at all time points were small and not clinically significant. When analysis was restricted to 146 participants not receiving long\u2010term inhaled tobramycin, results at 8, 32, 40, and 48 weeks reached statistical significance (evidence at 48 weeks was of high certainty). Results for forced vital capacity across the same six time points were imprecise and showed no clear effect of ataluren. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that probably more people receiving ataluren had acute kidney injury (absolute values not available), but fewer people experienced oropharyngeal pain (33 vs 119 per 1000 people). People receiving ataluren may experience fewer grade 3 adverse events (severe), and no participants experienced a grade 4 adverse event (life\u2010threatening or death). The included RCTs reported no deaths in either study group.",

            "llm_answer": "Ataluren, also known as PTC124, is a drug that has been studied for its potential to treat cystic fibrosis caused by nonsense mutations in the CFTR gene. Nonsense mutations are premature stop codons that can lead to the production of truncated or incomplete CFTR proteins, which are unable to function properly.\nStudies have shown that ataluren can increase the production of functional CFTR protein in people with cystic fibrosis who have nonsense mutations. It does this by inhibiting a cellular mechanism called nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), which normally degrades mRNAs that contain premature stop codons. By inhibiting NMD, ataluren allows the mRNA to be translated into a full-length CFTR protein, even if it contains a nonsense mutation.\nThe effects of ataluren on people with cystic fibrosis with a nonsense mutation in at least one allele of the CFTR gene have been studied in clinical trials. These studies have shown that ataluren can improve lung function, reduce the frequency of pulmonary exacerbations, and improve other measures of health status in people with cystic fibrosis who have nonsense mutations. However, the drug has not been shown to be effective in people with other types of CFTR mutations.\nIt's important to note that ataluren is not a cure for cystic fibrosis, and it does not restore normal function to the CFTR protein. However, it can help to improve the function of the protein in people with nonsense mutations, which can lead to improved health outcomes.",

            "gold_answer": "Although ataluren may improve lung function for people with cystic fibrosis with a nonsense mutation, these improvements are not clinically significant. Given the apparent lack of clinical benefit, ataluren does not have marketing authorization for this indication in the UK or the USA. Reviewers identified two RCTs with 517 people aged 6 to 53 years (mean 23 years) and 52% male with cystic fibrosis with a nonsense mutation in at least one allele of the CFTR gene that compared ataluren (40 mg/kg/d in divided doses) with placebo. Overall, ataluren led to a slightly greater increase in % predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV?) (on average, by 1.5% to 3.5% at six time points across 8 to 48 weeks); only the result at 8 weeks reached statistical significance, but increases at all time points were small and not clinically significant. When analysis was restricted to 146 participants not receiving long\u2010term inhaled tobramycin, results at 8, 32, 40, and 48 weeks reached statistical significance (evidence at 48 weeks was of high certainty). Results for forced vital capacity across the same six time points were imprecise and showed no clear effect of ataluren. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that probably more people receiving ataluren had acute kidney injury (absolute values not available), but fewer people experienced oropharyngeal pain (33 vs 119 per 1000 people). People receiving ataluren may experience fewer grade 3 adverse events (severe), and no participants experienced a grade 4 adverse event (life\u2010threatening or death). The included RCTs reported no deaths in either study group.",

            "llm_answer": "Ataluren, also known as PTC124, is a drug that has been studied for its potential to treat cystic fibrosis caused by nonsense mutations in the CFTR gene. Nonsense mutations are mutations that prematurely stop the production of a protein, in this case, the CFTR protein.\nStudies have shown that ataluren can help to restore the production of functional CFTR protein in people with cystic fibrosis who have nonsense mutations. By doing so, it may help to improve the function of the respiratory and digestive systems, which are affected by cystic fibrosis.\nIn a clinical trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine, ataluren was tested in people with cystic fibrosis who had at least one nonsense mutation in the CFTR gene. The results showed that ataluren significantly improved the function of the CFTR protein, as measured by the amount of salt and water that was absorbed by the body. The study also found that ataluren was generally well-tolerated, with the most common side effects being gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.\nHowever, it's important to note that ataluren is not a cure for cystic fibrosis, and it does not work for everyone with the disease. Additionally, it's important to note that ataluren is not approved by the FDA for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, and its use for this indication is considered experimental.\nIt's important to consult a healthcare professional to discuss the potential benefits and risks of ataluren for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, as well as to determine if it may be appropriate for an individual patient.",

Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that can help maintain a healthy gut microbiome, which is important for the development and function of various bodily systems, including the immune system.\nStudies have found that probiotics can help reduce the risk of preterm birth, which is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Probiotics have also been shown to reduce the risk of other complications in preterm infants, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious condition that can cause damage to the intestines.\nIt's important to note that not all probiotics are the same, and some strains have been found to be more effective than others in preventing morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. For example, the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any supplements during pregnancy, including probiotics, to ensure safety and effectiveness. Additionally, it's important to note that while probiotics can help reduce the risk of complications, they are not a guarantee against them, and other factors such as proper prenatal care, a healthy diet, and a safe delivery are also important for a healthy pregnancy and baby.",
