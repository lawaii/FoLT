However, it's essential to note that the use of EpAbs for COVID-19 treatment is still experimental and has not yet been approved by regulatory authorities.\nClinical trials have shown that EpAbs can be effective in reducing the severity of COVID-19 symptoms and the amount of viral load in the body. A study published in The New England Journal of Medicine found that EpAbs significantly improved clinical outcomes in patients with severe COVID-19, with a higher proportion of patients experiencing a significant improvement in symptoms compared to those receiving a placebo.\nHowever, it's important to note that the study also found that EpAbs were not effective in preventing the progression of COVID-19 to severe disease in patients who were already experiencing severe symptoms. Additionally, the long-term effects of EpAbs are not yet fully understood, and more research is needed to determine their safety and efficacy in the long term.\nIt's also worth noting that the use of EpAbs is not without risk. The treatment can cause side effects, such as allergic reactions, and there is a risk of transmitting infectious agents, such as viruses, through the use of equine-derived products.\nIn summary, while EpAbs have shown promise in reducing the severity of COVID-19 symptoms in adults with moderate to severe disease, their use is still experimental and more research is needed to fully understand their safety and efficacy. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional to discuss the potential benefits and risks of EpAbs and determine whether they may be appropriate for your specific situation.",

Although there appears to be little to no impact of increasing time spent in rehabilitation in outcomes (activities of daily living, activity and motor impairment measures of the upper and lower limb and serious adverse events), the reviewers rated the certainty of all available evidence to be low or very low, precluding a reliable answer to this question.",

Studies have shown that patients who participate in intensive rehabilitation programs, which typically involve at least 3 hours of therapy per day, 5-7 days per week, for at least 3-6 months, experience greater improvements in motor function, cognition, and daily living activities compared to those who receive less intensive rehabilitation. Additionally, longer rehabilitation programs may reduce the risk of complications, such as falls and readmissions, and improve long-term outcomes. However, it's important to note that individual results may vary and the optimal duration and intensity of rehabilitation can depend on various factors, including the severity of the stroke, age, and overall health.",

Although there appears to be little to no impact of increasing time spent in rehabilitation in outcomes (activities of daily living, activity and motor impairment measures of the upper and lower limb and serious adverse events), the reviewers rated the certainty of all available evidence to be low or very low, precluding a reliable answer to this question.",

            "gold_answer": "Diabetic macular edema can be treated with intravitreal dexamethasone or antiVEGF injections. Dexamethasone is given four to five times monthly, whereas antiVEGF requires monthly treatment. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that antiVEGF treatment probably leads to modestly superior vision at 1 year compared with dexamethasone (on average, by 0.07 logMAR), but low\u2010certainty evidence suggests a better anatomical result in terms of change in central retinal thickness with dexamethasone (on average, by 21.09 microns) for people with diabetes and macular edema. However, moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that dexamethasone resulted in greater cataract progression at 12 to 24 months (353 vs 83 per 1000 eyes) and a higher requirement for topical anti\u2010glaucoma treatment at 24 months (392 vs 82 per 1000 eyes). Also, very low\u2010certainty evidence suggests a higher surgery rate for glaucoma with dexamethasone at 24 months (16 vs 5 per 1000 eyes). The higher side effect ratio and the slightly poorer visual outcome with dexamethasone need to be balanced against the lower\u2010frequency dosing regimen.",

            "llm_answer": "Intravitreal dexamethasone and intravitreal anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) are both commonly used treatments for macular edema in people with diabetes.\nIntravitreal dexamethasone is a corticosteroid that works by reducing inflammation and swelling in the retina. It is typically administered as a series of injections into the eye, and has been shown to improve vision and reduce macular edema in people with diabetic retinopathy.\nIntravitreal anti-VEGF, on the other hand, works by blocking the growth of new blood vessels and reducing the amount of fluid leakage in the retina. It is also administered as a series of injections into the eye, and has been shown to improve vision and reduce macular edema in people with diabetic retinopathy.\nBoth treatments have their own advantages and disadvantages. Intravitreal dexamethasone may be more effective in reducing inflammation and swelling in the short term, but its effects may wear off over time, requiring repeated injections. Intravitreal anti-VEGF, on the other hand, may have a more sustained effect, but may require more frequent injections to maintain its effects.\nThere have been some studies that have compared the two treatments directly. A 2019 Cochrane review found that both treatments were effective in improving vision and reducing macular edema, but that intravitreal anti-VEGF may have a slight advantage in terms of sustained efficacy. However, the review also noted that the quality of the evidence was generally low, and that further research is needed to fully understand the comparative effects of the two treatments.\nUltimately, the choice between intravitreal dexamethasone and intravitreal anti-VEGF will depend on the individual patient and the specific characteristics of their macular edema. Your eye doctor will be able to help determine which treatment is best for you based on a comprehensive evaluation of your condition.",

            "gold_answer": "Diabetic macular edema can be treated with intravitreal dexamethasone or antiVEGF injections. Dexamethasone is given four to five times monthly, whereas antiVEGF requires monthly treatment. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that antiVEGF treatment probably leads to modestly superior vision at 1 year compared with dexamethasone (on average, by 0.07 logMAR), but low\u2010certainty evidence suggests a better anatomical result in terms of change in central retinal thickness with dexamethasone (on average, by 21.09 microns) for people with diabetes and macular edema. However, moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that dexamethasone resulted in greater cataract progression at 12 to 24 months (353 vs 83 per 1000 eyes) and a higher requirement for topical anti\u2010glaucoma treatment at 24 months (392 vs 82 per 1000 eyes). Also, very low\u2010certainty evidence suggests a higher surgery rate for glaucoma with dexamethasone at 24 months (16 vs 5 per 1000 eyes). The higher side effect ratio and the slightly poorer visual outcome with dexamethasone need to be balanced against the lower\u2010frequency dosing regimen.",

            "llm_answer": "Intravitreal dexamethasone and intravitreal anti-VEGF are both commonly used treatments for macular edema in people with diabetes. However, they have different mechanisms of action and may have different effects on the body.\nIntravitreal dexamethasone is a corticosteroid that works by reducing inflammation and swelling in the retina. It is typically used in cases where the macular edema is caused by inflammation, such as in diabetic macular edema (DME) or uveitis. Dexamethasone has been shown to improve vision and reduce retinal thickness in people with DME.\nIntravitreal anti-VEGF, on the other hand, works by blocking the growth of new blood vessels and reducing the amount of fluid in the retina. It is typically used in cases where the macular edema is caused by the growth of new blood vessels, such as in proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Anti-VEGF has been shown to improve vision and reduce the risk of vision loss in people with PDR.\nIt's important to note that both treatments have potential side effects and risks. Intravitreal dexamethasone can cause cataracts, glaucoma, and increased intraocular pressure, while intravitreal anti-VEGF can cause inflammation and bleeding in the eye.\nThe choice between intravitreal dexamethasone and intravitreal anti-VEGF will depend on the specific cause of the macular edema and the individual patient's medical history and response to previous treatments. Your eye doctor will be able to determine which treatment is best for you based on a comprehensive evaluation of your condition.\nIt's important to note that these treatments are not mutually exclusive, and your eye doctor may recommend a combination of both treatments or a sequence of treatments to achieve the best possible outcome.",

            "gold_answer": "For people living with HIV with suspected high viral loads attending health facilities and using central laboratory testing for HIV viral load as a reference standard, 14 studies (20 evaluations) with 8659 participants reported accuracy of point\u2010of\u2010care tests at the clinical threshold of \u2265 1000 copies/mL with average sensitivities ranging from 89% to 100% and specificities ranging from 19% to 100%. The pooled estimate was 96.6% for sensitivity and 95.7% for specificity. Using these estimates and at a prevalence of 2.5%, reviewers reported that for every 1000 people tested, 42 could be wrongly classified as having high viral load, and 1 case could be missed; values at 10% prevalence could be 39 and 3, respectively; at 30% prevalence could be 30 and 10; and at 40% prevalence, 26 and 14, respectively.

However, these tests may not perform as well in detecting low viral load levels.

            "gold_answer": "For people living with HIV with suspected high viral loads attending health facilities and using central laboratory testing for HIV viral load as a reference standard, 14 studies (20 evaluations) with 8659 participants reported accuracy of point\u2010of\u2010care tests at the clinical threshold of \u2265 1000 copies/mL with average sensitivities ranging from 89% to 100% and specificities ranging from 19% to 100%. The pooled estimate was 96.6% for sensitivity and 95.7% for specificity. Using these estimates and at a prevalence of 2.5%, reviewers reported that for every 1000 people tested, 42 could be wrongly classified as having high viral load, and 1 case could be missed; values at 10% prevalence could be 39 and 3, respectively; at 30% prevalence could be 30 and 10; and at 40% prevalence, 26 and 14, respectively. It is worth noting that 80% of studies were conducted in sub\u2010Saharan Africa.",

However, studies have shown that point-of-care tests can provide accurate results for viral load monitoring in HIV-infected individuals, with sensitivity and specificity ranging from 80-100% and 80-100%, respectively.\nOne study published in the Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes found that the sensitivity and specificity of a point-of-care test for viral load monitoring were 94.9% and 95.5%, respectively, compared to standard laboratory tests. Another study published in the Journal of Clinical Virology found that the accuracy of a point-of-care test for detecting high viral load levels was 97.4% compared to standard laboratory tests.\nIt is important to note that the accuracy of point-of-care tests can be affected by various factors, such as the quality of the test kit, the training of healthcare workers, and the quality of the sample being tested. Additionally, point-of-care tests may not be able to detect very low or very high viral load levels as accurately as standard laboratory tests.\nOverall, point-of-care tests can be a useful tool for viral load monitoring in people living with HIV, particularly in resource-limited settings where access to standard laboratory tests may be limited. However, it is important to use these tests in conjunction with clinical evaluation and other laboratory tests to ensure accurate diagnosis and treatment.",

            "llm_answer": "Resin fissure sealants and fluoride varnish are both effective methods for preventing dental decay in children and adolescents. However, they work in different ways and have different advantages.\nResin fissure sealants are a type of preventive dental treatment that is applied to the chewing surfaces of teeth, particularly in the molars, to prevent decay from forming in the crevices and grooves. They work by sealing the fissures and grooves, making it difficult for bacteria and food particles to accumulate and cause decay. Resin fissure sealants are typically applied in a dental office setting and can last for several years.\nFluoride varnish, on the other hand, is a topical fluoride treatment that is applied to the teeth to prevent decay and strengthen tooth enamel. It works by releasing fluoride ions, which bind to the tooth surface and make it more resistant to acid attacks from plaque bacteria and sugars. Fluoride varnish can be applied in a dental office setting or at home as part of a regular oral hygiene routine.\nBoth resin fissure sealants and fluoride varnish have been shown to be effective in preventing dental decay in children and adolescents. However, resin fissure sealants may be more effective in preventing decay in the molars, while fluoride varnish may be more effective in preventing decay on the smooth surfaces of teeth.\nIt's important to note that both treatments are most effective when used in combination with good oral hygiene practices, such as brushing and flossing regularly, and avoiding sugary snacks and drinks.

Each comparison was assessed by a single RCT. The largest RCT (1962 women) compared ibuprofen 1200 mg/d with placebo, but reported only on IUD removal, finding little to no difference between groups. One RCT with 310 women reported that tolfenamic acid led to fewer heavier\u2010than\u2010normal menses and fewer clots in menstrual blood compared with placebo (510 vs 658 per 1000 menses and 381 vs 587 per 1000 menses, respectively); however, the trial failed to report some important methodological details and may have been subject to bias.

Studies have shown that NSAIDs are effective in reducing pain and bleeding associated with IUD insertion and use. A systematic review and meta-analysis published in the journal Contraception found that NSAIDs were significantly more effective than placebo in reducing pain and bleeding associated with IUD insertion.\nIn terms of comparing NSAIDs with alternative analgesics, a study published in the Journal of Pain and Symptom Management found that NSAIDs were more effective than acetaminophen in reducing pain associated with IUD insertion. However, it's important to note that the study had a small sample size and further research is needed to confirm these findings.\nIt's also worth noting that different NSAIDs may have different levels of effectiveness and side effects. For example, a study published in the Journal of Women's Health found that ibuprofen was more effective than naproxen in reducing pain and bleeding associated with IUD insertion. However, ibuprofen may have a higher risk of gastrointestinal side effects compared to naproxen.\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare provider to determine the best treatment plan for managing pain and bleeding associated with IUD use. They can help determine the most appropriate NSAID or alternative analgesic based on individual factors such as medical history, current medications, and side effect profile.",

Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests little to no difference in any grade of adverse events, but results for progression at two to four years and for bladder cancer\u2013related mortality at two years were very imprecise. Evidence regarding overall survival at two years was very uncertain, and no RCTs reported quality of life.",

Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests little to no difference in any grade of adverse events, but results for progression at two to four years and for bladder cancer\u2013related mortality at two years were very imprecise. Evidence regarding overall survival at two years was very uncertain, and no RCTs reported quality of life.",

In a 2016 clinical practice guideline, the AUA recommended the use of intravesical gemcitabine as an optional adjunct to TURBT for patients with high-risk NMIBC.\nThe benefits of intravesical gemcitabine for NMIBC patients undergoing TURBT include:\n1. Reduced recurrence rate: Intravesical gemcitabine has been shown to reduce the risk of recurrence in patients with NMIBC, with some studies reporting a reduction in recurrence rate of up to 30-40%.\n2. Improved overall survival: Intravesical gemcitabine has also been shown to improve overall survival in patients with NMIBC, with some studies reporting a significant reduction in mortality rate.\n3. Minimally invasive: Intravesical gemcitabine is a minimally invasive treatment that can be administered during TURBT, which is a relatively quick and straightforward procedure.\n4. Few side effects: Intravesical gemcitabine is generally well-tolerated, with few side effects reported. The most common side effects include bladder irritation, urinary tract infection, and hematuria (blood in the urine).\nIt is important to note that while intravesical gemcitabine has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of recurrence and improving overall survival for patients with NMIBC undergoing TURBT, it is not suitable for all patients.

            "llm_answer": "Antecolic reconstruction and retrocolic reconstruction are both surgical techniques used to reconstruct the digestive system after a partial pancreaticoduodenectomy, a surgical procedure that removes a portion of the pancreas and duodenum to treat various conditions such as pancreatic cancer.\nAntecolic reconstruction involves attaching the pancreatic remnant to the proximal small intestine, creating a new connection between the pancreas and the small intestine. This technique is often used when the pancreatic duct is not accessible or has been damaged during the surgery.\nRetrocolic reconstruction, on the other hand, involves attaching the pancreatic remnant to the distal small intestine, creating a new connection between the pancreas and the small intestine that is closer to the rectum. This technique is often used when the pancreatic duct is preserved and functional.\nBoth techniques have their advantages and disadvantages, and the choice between them depends on various factors, such as the extent of the resection, the patient's overall health, and the surgeon's preference.\nIn general, antecolic reconstruction may be associated with a higher risk of pancreatic fistula and delayed gastric emptying, but may also provide better preservation of pancreatic function. Retrocolic reconstruction, on the other hand, may have a lower risk of pancreatic fistula and delayed gastric emptying, but may also result in a longer length of stay in the hospital and a higher risk of small bowel obstruction.\nIt is important to note that the choice between antecolic and retrocolic reconstruction should be individualized and made by a qualified surgeon who has experience in performing both techniques. The surgeon will take into account various factors, including the patient's specific condition, overall health, and preferences, to determine the most appropriate technique for the patient.",

Moderate\u2010quality evidence showed that this benefit was not sustained in the longer\u2010term (5 years). Low\u2010quality evidence suggests there was no benefit of an adjunctive corticosteroid in terms of reducing rates of disabling neurological deficit, ether within 24 months or at 5 years. There was no apparent impact of adjunctive corticosteroids on the incidences of hepatitis, hyperglycemia/glycosuria, gastrointestinal bleeding, or invasive bacterial infection but event rates were very low meaning conclusions cannot be drawn.",

Studies have consistently demonstrated that corticosteroids reduce the risk of death and disability in patients with tuberculous meningitis, particularly in those with severe disease. The use of corticosteroids has been associated with a significant reduction in mortality rates, from approximately 30-40% in untreated patients to around 10-20% in patients receiving corticosteroids. Additionally, corticosteroids have been shown to reduce the risk of long-term disability, such as hearing loss and cognitive impairment.

Moderate\u2010quality evidence showed that this benefit was not sustained in the longer\u2010term (5 years). Low\u2010quality evidence suggests there was no benefit of an adjunctive corticosteroid in terms of reducing rates of disabling neurological deficit, ether within 24 months or at 5 years. There was no apparent impact of adjunctive corticosteroids on the incidences of hepatitis, hyperglycemia/glycosuria, gastrointestinal bleeding, or invasive bacterial infection but event rates were very low meaning conclusions cannot be drawn.",

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers found no conclusive RCT evidence suggesting that administration of probiotics to pregnant women was superior or inferior to placebo in reducing morbidity or mortality in preterm infants. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that in pregnant women who received probiotics, the risk of preterm birth (< 37 weeks) and miscarriage/stillbirth was no more or less likely compared with those who did not receive probiotics. Only one RCT (159 infants) reported no incidences of early neonatal sepsis (\u2264 3 days) in either trial arm. For most outcomes, event rates were very low or there were no events in both arms. There is a lack of data on neonatal short\u2010term (early or late sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, neonatal death, hospital stay) and long\u2010term (major neurodevelopmental disability) potential benefits or harms following probiotic administration. None of the trials included women with a previous history of preterm birth, multiple pregnancy, or uterine anomaly. Reviewers did not assess serious adverse maternal or neonatal adverse events following use of probiotics.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "RCT (rct): A study which tests the effectiveness and safety of treatments or procedures as fairly and objectively as possible. By randomly assigning patients to different treatments for the same problem, the results can be assessed equally with the aim of discovering the best possible procedure for the condition.\nPLACEBO (placebo): an inactive substance; a pill/liquid that contains no medicine\nMORBIDITY (morbidity): undesired result or complication\nMORTALITY (mortality): death\nRISK (risk): The chance that an activity or hazard will give rise to harm. Risk is generally given in terms of numerical odds (1 in 10) or percentages (10%).\nSEPSIS (sepsis): The immune system's overreaction to an infection or injury which can lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and death.\nPOTENTIAL (potential): possible\nPOTENTIATE (potentiate): increase or multiply the effect of a drug or toxin (poison) by giving another drug or toxin at the same time (sometimes an unintentional result)\nPOTENTIATOR (potentiator): an agent that helps another agent work better\nASSESS (assess): to learn about, measure, evaluate, look at",

            "llm_answer": "Yes, probiotics administered to pregnant women have been shown to help prevent morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that can help maintain a healthy gut microbiome, which is important for the development and function of various bodily systems, including the immune system.\nStudies have found that probiotics can help reduce the risk of preterm birth, which is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Probiotics have also been shown to reduce the risk of other complications in preterm infants, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious condition that can cause damage to the intestines.\nIt's important to note that not all probiotics are the same, and some strains have been found to be more effective than others in preventing morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. For example, the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any supplements during pregnancy, including probiotics, to ensure safety and effectiveness. Additionally, it's important to note that while probiotics can help reduce the risk of complications, they are not a guarantee against them, and other factors such as proper prenatal care, a healthy diet, and a safe delivery are also important for a healthy pregnancy and baby.",
