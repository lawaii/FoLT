            "gold_answer": "High\u2010certainty evidence shows that compared with placebo, fewer people who received BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) and mRNA\u20101273 (ModernaTX) vaccines against COVID\u201019 developed confirmed symptomatic COVID\u201019 (3838 and 4603 fewer cases per 100,000 people, respectively; all results on average), and fewer people developed severe or critical COVID\u201019 (96 and 735 fewer cases per 100,000 people, respectively). Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that probably fewer people who received ModernaTX developed a confirmed SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection (6563 fewer cases per 100,000 people), and probably fewer people who received CureVac AG had confirmed symptomatic COVID\u201019 (572 fewer cases per 100,000 people). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests little to no difference between Pfizer/BioNTech or ModernaTX and placebo in all\u2010cause mortality. Based on moderate\u2010 to low\u2010certainty evidence, there was little to no increase in serious adverse events with RNA\u2010based vaccines over placebo. High\u2010certainty evidence shows that compared with placebo, more people who received ModernaTX and CureVac AG developed systemic reactogenicity events (121 and 305 more cases per 1000 people, respectively) and local reactogenicity events (486 and 606 more cases per 1000 people, respectively). Based on moderate\u2010 to low\u2010certainty evidence, there was also a higher frequency of any adverse event with all RNA\u2010based vaccines compared with placebo.",

            "gold_answer": "High\u2010certainty evidence shows that compared with placebo, fewer people who received BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) and mRNA\u20101273 (ModernaTX) vaccines against COVID\u201019 developed confirmed symptomatic COVID\u201019 (3838 and 4603 fewer cases per 100,000 people, respectively; all results on average), and fewer people developed severe or critical COVID\u201019 (96 and 735 fewer cases per 100,000 people, respectively). Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that probably fewer people who received ModernaTX developed a confirmed SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection (6563 fewer cases per 100,000 people), and probably fewer people who received CureVac AG had confirmed symptomatic COVID\u201019 (572 fewer cases per 100,000 people). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests little to no difference between Pfizer/BioNTech or ModernaTX and placebo in all\u2010cause mortality. Based on moderate\u2010 to low\u2010certainty evidence, there was little to no increase in serious adverse events with RNA\u2010based vaccines over placebo. High\u2010certainty evidence shows that compared with placebo, more people who received ModernaTX and CureVac AG developed systemic reactogenicity events (121 and 305 more cases per 1000 people, respectively) and local reactogenicity events (486 and 606 more cases per 1000 people, respectively). Based on moderate\u2010 to low\u2010certainty evidence, there was also a higher frequency of any adverse event with all RNA\u2010based vaccines compared with placebo.",

Rapid development and production: RNA-based vaccines can be developed and produced quickly, which is important in responding to a pandemic like COVID-19.\n2. Induction of both antibody and T-cell responses: RNA-based vaccines can stimulate both antibody and T-cell responses, which can provide broader and longer-lasting protection against COVID-19.\n3. Flexibility: RNA-based vaccines can be easily modified to adapt to different strains of the virus, allowing for rapid response to new variants.\n4. Safety: RNA-based vaccines have shown a strong safety profile, with minimal side effects observed in clinical trials.\nRisks:\n1. Limited data: While RNA-based vaccines have shown promise, there is still limited data on their long-term safety and effectiveness, particularly in certain populations such as children, pregnant women, and immunocompromised individuals.\n2. Allergic reactions: As with any vaccine or medication, there is a risk of allergic reactions to RNA-based vaccines.\n3. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome: There have been some concerns about a potential link between RNA-based vaccines and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome, a rare autoimmune disorder. However, the current evidence suggests that the risk of developing Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome from RNA-based vaccines is very low.\n4. Cost: RNA-based vaccines can be expensive to produce and distribute, which may limit access to them, particularly in low-resource settings.\nIt's important to note that the benefits and risks of RNA-based vaccines are not unique to this type of vaccine, and that all vaccines and medications have their own set of benefits and risks.

            "gold_answer": "Compared with a gonadotropin\u2010releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist (when specified, goserelin or leuprorelin) for men with hormone\u2010sensitive prostate cancer, low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that subcutaneous degarelix (240 mg initial dose followed by a maintenance dose of 80 mg monthly in most trials) could reduce the number of men with biochemical progression by 12 months (79 vs 129 per 1000 men; all results on average). Degarelix may also reduce the mortality rate (10 vs 21 per 1000 men; based on 1821 men), but probably has little to no impact on quality of life (moderate\u2010certainty evidence). In terms of adverse events, more men experienced a non\u2010serious adverse event, but fewer had a serious adverse event (low\u2010certainty evidence) with degarelix than with a GnRH agonist (792 vs 734 per 1000 men and 94 vs 117 per 1000 men, respectively). The most common adverse effects were urinary tract infection, anemia, and back pain for the GnRH agonist group. Also, injection site pain and an increase in alanine aminotransferase were mostly seen in the degarelix group. No information regarding overall survival, cancer\u2010specific survival, and clinical progression was reported in the trials.",

            "llm_answer": "Degarelix and GnRH agonists are both used to treat hormone-sensitive prostate cancer by reducing the levels of testosterone, which can slow the growth of cancer cells. However, they work differently and have different side effect profiles.\nDegarelix is a GnRH receptor antagonist, which means it binds to GnRH receptors on the pituitary gland and prevents the release of LH and FSH, leading to a rapid decrease in testosterone levels. It is administered as a depot injection every 28 days.\nGnRH agonists, on the other hand, work by stimulating the pituitary gland to release LH and FSH, which in turn stimulates the production of testosterone. However, over time, the pituitary gland becomes desensitized to the agonist, leading to a decrease in testosterone production. GnRH agonists are typically administered as a monthly injection or implant.\nStudies have shown that degarelix is more effective than GnRH agonists in reducing testosterone levels and PSA levels in men with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. Degarelix has also been shown to have a more rapid onset of action compared to GnRH agonists.\nIn terms of side effects, degarelix has been associated with a higher incidence of hot flashes, while GnRH agonists have been associated with a higher incidence of fatigue, weight gain, and metabolic changes.\nIn summary, degarelix and GnRH agonists are both effective treatments for hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, but degarelix has a more rapid onset of action and is more effective in reducing testosterone levels and PSA levels. However, the choice between the two agents depends on individual patient factors and preferences, such as tolerance to side effects and administration schedule.",

            "gold_answer": "Compared with a gonadotropin\u2010releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist (when specified, goserelin or leuprorelin) for men with hormone\u2010sensitive prostate cancer, low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that subcutaneous degarelix (240 mg initial dose followed by a maintenance dose of 80 mg monthly in most trials) could reduce the number of men with biochemical progression by 12 months (79 vs 129 per 1000 men; all results on average). Degarelix may also reduce the mortality rate (10 vs 21 per 1000 men; based on 1821 men), but probably has little to no impact on quality of life (moderate\u2010certainty evidence). In terms of adverse events, more men experienced a non\u2010serious adverse event, but fewer had a serious adverse event (low\u2010certainty evidence) with degarelix than with a GnRH agonist (792 vs 734 per 1000 men and 94 vs 117 per 1000 men, respectively). The most common adverse effects were urinary tract infection, anemia, and back pain for the GnRH agonist group. Also, injection site pain and an increase in alanine aminotransferase were mostly seen in the degarelix group. No information regarding overall survival, cancer\u2010specific survival, and clinical progression was reported in the trials.",

            "llm_answer": "Degarelix and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists are both used to treat men with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. They work by reducing the levels of testosterone in the body, which can slow the growth of prostate cancer.\nDegarelix is a type of GnRH receptor antagonist, which means it works by blocking the action of GnRH on the pituitary gland. This leads to a decrease in the production of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone, which in turn reduces the production of testosterone.\nGnRH agonists, on the other hand, work by stimulating the pituitary gland to produce a surge of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone, which then leads to a decrease in testosterone production.\nBoth degarelix and GnRH agonists have been shown to be effective in reducing testosterone levels and slowing the growth of prostate cancer. However, they have some differences in terms of their side effects and administration.\nDegarelix is given as a monthly injection, while GnRH agonists are typically given as a monthly or quarterly injection. Degarelix has been shown to have a more rapid onset of action compared to GnRH agonists, with testosterone levels decreasing within 24 hours of the first dose. GnRH agonists, on the other hand, may take several weeks to achieve the same level of testosterone suppression.\nIn terms of side effects, both drugs can cause hot flashes, erectile dysfunction, and decreased libido. However, degarelix has been shown to have a lower incidence of hot flashes compared to GnRH agonists. Additionally, degarelix has been associated with a lower risk of bone fractures compared to GnRH agonists.\nIn summary, both degarelix and GnRH agonists are effective treatments for hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, but they have",

The strategy of using combined ICIs is also associated with better overall survival for those with PD\u2010L1 expression \u2265 50% (620 versus 510 per 1000 people; moderate\u2010certainty evidence) and fewer grade 3/4 adverse events (280 versus 360 per 1000 people; low\u2010certainty evidence); results for progression\u2010free survival and tumor response are imprecise, and quality of life information is not available. The benefit of ICIs is less consistent when the population includes people with lower PD\u2010L1 expression.",

            "llm_answer": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and platinum-based chemotherapy are both common treatments for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). ICIs, such as pembrolizumab, nivolumab, and atezolizumab, work by blocking proteins on immune cells that normally prevent them from attacking cancer cells, while platinum-based chemotherapy kills cancer cells using platinum-based drugs.\nIn general, ICIs are preferred over platinum-based chemotherapy for several reasons:\n1. Improved overall survival: ICIs have been shown to improve overall survival in patients with advanced NSCLC, with some studies demonstrating a survival benefit of up to 10-15 months compared to chemotherapy.\n2. Better side effect profile: ICIs tend to have a more favorable side effect profile compared to chemotherapy, with fewer instances of severe side effects such as nausea, hair loss, and bone marrow suppression.\n3. Targeted therapy: ICIs target specific immune cells, which can result in a more targeted and effective response against cancer cells, whereas chemotherapy kills both cancerous and healthy cells.\n4. Potential for long-term remission: Some patients treated with ICIs have experienced long-term remission, with some studies reporting remission lasting up to 5 years or more.\n5. Combination therapy: ICIs can be combined with chemotherapy or other treatments to enhance their effectiveness, providing patients with more options and potentially improving outcomes.\nHowever, it's important to note that not all patients will respond well to ICIs, and some may experience significant side effects. Platinum-based chemotherapy remains a viable option for patients who do not respond well to ICIs or have specific health conditions that make them ineligible for immunotherapy. Ultimately, the choice between ICIs and platinum-based chemotherapy depends on various factors, including the patient's overall health, tumor characteristics, and treatment history.",

            "llm_answer": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and platinum-based chemotherapy are both common treatments for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The choice between the two depends on various factors, including the patient's overall health, tumor characteristics, and preferences. Here's a comparison of the two treatments:\n1. Mechanism of action: ICIs work by blocking proteins on immune cells that normally prevent them from attacking cancer cells, thus unleashing the immune system to fight cancer. Platinum-based chemotherapy, on the other hand, kills cancer cells directly by damaging their DNA.\n2. Efficacy: Both treatments have been shown to be effective in advanced NSCLC, but ICIs have been associated with longer overall survival and response rates compared to chemotherapy in some patient populations, such as those with high PD-L1 expression or those who have not received prior chemotherapy. However, chemotherapy may be more effective in patients with squamous cell histology.\n3. Side effects: ICIs are generally better tolerated than chemotherapy, with fewer severe side effects such as nausea, hair loss, and bone marrow suppression. However, ICIs can cause unique side effects related to immune system activation, such as skin rash, diarrhea, and inflammation of certain organs.\n4. Administration: ICIs are usually given as intravenous infusions every few weeks, while chemotherapy is typically administered in cycles of several weeks, with a few days of treatment followed by a rest period.\n5. Cost: ICIs are generally more expensive than chemotherapy, especially considering their higher cost per cycle and the need for ongoing treatment.\n6. Patient population: ICIs are approved for use in patients with advanced NSCLC, regardless of histology, while chemotherapy is typically reserved for patients with squamous cell histology or those who have progressed after previous treatment.\n7. Combination therapy: Both ICIs and chemotherapy can be combined with other treatments, such as targeted therapies or other immunotherapies, to enhance their effectiveness.\nIt's important to note that the choice between ICIs and chemother",

Bottles can also lead to a slower transition to exclusive breastfeeding and a shorter duration of breastfeeding overall.\nAvoiding bottles during the early days of breastfeeding can help preterm infants learn to latch and breastfeed effectively, establishing a strong foundation for continued breastfeeding. In addition, skin-to-skin contact and frequent breastfeeding attempts can help promote milk production and improve the likelihood of successful breastfeeding.\nHowever, it's important to note that every baby is different, and some preterm infants may require additional support or may not be able to breastfeed immediately. In these cases, bottles may be necessary to ensure the baby's nutrition and health. It's essential to work closely with a lactation consultant or healthcare provider to determine the best approach for each individual baby.",

            "gold_answer": "Intermittent pneumatic leg compression (IPC) combined with pharmacological agents may decrease risk of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis, when compared with IPC alone or with pharmacological prophylaxis alone . Results on bleeding are very uncertain. For the comparison of IPC plus pharmacological prophylaxis versus IPC alone in surgical patients, low\u2010certainty evidence suggests there may be a lower incidence of pulmonary embolism (3 vs 6 per 1000 people; all results on average) and deep vein thrombosis (18 vs 34 per 1000 people) with combined IPC. Results showing an increase in the incidence of bleeding (46 vs 8 per 1000 people) and major bleeding (9 vs 2 per 1000 people) among those receiving IPC plus pharmacological prophylaxis were very uncertain. For the comparison of IPC plus pharmacological prophylaxis versus pharmacological prophylaxis alone in surgical patients, high\u2010certainty evidence shows a lower incidence of deep vein thrombosis among people receiving combined IPC and pharmacological prophylaxis (34 vs 84 per 1000 people). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests there may be a lower incidence of pulmonary embolism with IPC plus pharmacological prophylaxis (5 vs 10 per 1000 people). RCTs reported no obvious difference between groups in the incidence of bleeding, but the evidence was very uncertain. None of the identified trials assessed mortality for either comparison.",

            "gold_answer": "Intermittent pneumatic leg compression (IPC) combined with pharmacological agents may decrease risk of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis, when compared with IPC alone or with pharmacological prophylaxis alone . Results on bleeding are very uncertain. For the comparison of IPC plus pharmacological prophylaxis versus IPC alone in surgical patients, low\u2010certainty evidence suggests there may be a lower incidence of pulmonary embolism (3 vs 6 per 1000 people; all results on average) and deep vein thrombosis (18 vs 34 per 1000 people) with combined IPC. Results showing an increase in the incidence of bleeding (46 vs 8 per 1000 people) and major bleeding (9 vs 2 per 1000 people) among those receiving IPC plus pharmacological prophylaxis were very uncertain. For the comparison of IPC plus pharmacological prophylaxis versus pharmacological prophylaxis alone in surgical patients, high\u2010certainty evidence shows a lower incidence of deep vein thrombosis among people receiving combined IPC and pharmacological prophylaxis (34 vs 84 per 1000 people). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests there may be a lower incidence of pulmonary embolism with IPC plus pharmacological prophylaxis (5 vs 10 per 1000 people). RCTs reported no obvious difference between groups in the incidence of bleeding, but the evidence was very uncertain. None of the identified trials assessed mortality for either comparison.",

            "llm_answer": "Yes, combined intermittent pneumatic leg compression and pharmacological prophylaxis can help prevent venous thromboembolism (VTE) in people undergoing surgery. Intermittent pneumatic leg compression devices apply pressure to the legs to help improve blood flow and reduce the risk of blood clots, while pharmacological prophylaxis, such as anticoagulant medications, can further reduce the risk of VTE. Studies have shown that the combination of these two methods can be effective in reducing the incidence of VTE in surgical patients. However, it's important to note that the optimal combination and duration of treatment may vary depending on the individual patient and the type of surgery being performed. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the best course of prevention for a particular patient.",

            "gold_answer": "In children with newly diagnosed IgAV rash and no significant kidney disease, prednisone (1 to 2 mg/kg/day orally for 7 to 14 days, gradually reducing the dose over 7 to 14 days) has no apparent effect on the number of children developing persistent or severe kidney disease (based on moderate\u2010 and low\u2010certainty evidence, respectively), when compared with no treatment. There also appeared to be no differences between groups in the surrogate outcomes of hematuria, proteinuria, glomerular filtration rate, or hypertension, but the analyses were small and underpowered, making it difficult to detect differences even if present. The incidence of adverse events was very low, and the analyses too small to reliably detect differences between groups. The trials did not report on serum creatinine or the number of children developing end\u2010stage kidney disease or nephrotic syndrome.",

The impact of prednisone on renal outcomes in children with IgAV is not well established.\nA study published in the Journal of Pediatric Rheumatology found that prednisone therapy was associated with improved renal outcomes in children with IgAV. The study included 23 children with IgAV, and found that those who received prednisone had a lower risk of developing end-stage renal disease compared to those who did not receive prednisone.\nHowever, it's important to note that this study had a small sample size and further research is needed to confirm these findings. Additionally, prednisone can have side effects, such as weight gain, mood changes, and increased risk of infections, so it's important to closely monitor children taking this medication.\nIn summary, while there is limited research on the topic, the available evidence suggests that prednisone may have a positive impact on renal outcomes in children with IgAV. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings and to determine the optimal dosage and duration of prednisone therapy for children with IgAV. It's important to work closely with a healthcare provider to carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks of prednisone therapy for each individual child.",

When reviewers compared SSRIs or mirtazapine versus TCAs, there was little to no difference between groups for any outcome. However, the certainty of the evidence for all outcomes is very low, which precludes a sound answer to this clinical question.",

            "gold_answer": "Evidence shows that reducing sodium intake to 66 mmol/d (mean reduction of 67%) reduces systolic blood pressure in adolescents and adults (age range 12 to 73) who were normotensive by 1.14 to 4.02 mmHg (all results on average) or hypertensive by 5.71 to 7.75 mmHg. Evidence also shows a reduction in diastolic blood pressure in people who were hypertensive by 2.68 to 2.91 mmHg; results for normotensive populations were imprecise. Certainty of the evidence varied according to the ethnicity of the population assessed: high certainty for white populations, moderate to low certainty for Asian populations, and low certainty for black populations. Reviewers identified concomitant increases in cholesterol (by 5.19 mg/dL), triglycerides (by 7.10 mg/dL), low\u2010density lipoprotein (by 2.46 mg/dL), aldosterone (by 101.98 pg/mL), noradrenaline (by 62.33 pg/mL), and adrenaline (by 7.55 pg/mL) with sodium reduction. It is worth noting that the duration of interventions was short (32% \u2264 1 week, 19% 1 week to 1 month, 7% \u2265 3 months); therefore the effects of sustained dietary salt reduction remain unclear.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "SYSTOLIC (systolic): top number in blood pressure; pressure during active contraction of the heart\nHYPERTENSION (hypertension): high blood pressure\nDIASTOLIC (diastolic): lower number in a blood pressure reading\nASSESS (assess): to learn about, measure, evaluate, look at\nCHOLESTEROL (cholesterol): The name for a group of blood fats. It includes LDL, or low-density lipoprotein, which is \u2018bad\u2019 cholesterol; HDL, or high-density lipoprotein, which is \u2018good\u2019 cholesterol; and triglycerides (TG).

            "llm_answer": "Dietary salt reduction has been shown to have various effects on cardiovascular biomarkers and hormone levels in both healthy normotensive and hypertensive adolescents and adults. These effects include:\n1. Blood pressure: Reducing dietary salt intake has been shown to lower blood pressure in both normotensive and hypertensive individuals.\n2. Cardiovascular biomarkers: Dietary salt reduction has been associated with decreased levels of cardiovascular biomarkers, such as C-reactive protein and interleukin-6, which are indicators of inflammation and cardiovascular risk.\n3. Hormone levels: Reducing dietary salt intake has been shown to affect hormone levels, including decreased levels of aldosterone, a hormone that regulates sodium and potassium balance, and increased levels of renin, an enzyme that helps regulate blood pressure.\n4. Urinary albumin excretion: Dietary salt reduction has been associated with decreased urinary albumin excretion, which is a marker of kidney damage and cardiovascular risk.\n5. Cardiac function: Reducing dietary salt intake has been shown to improve cardiac function, including increased cardiac output and reduced systemic vascular resistance.\n6. Endothelial function: Dietary salt reduction has been associated with improved endothelial function, which is important for maintaining healthy blood vessels and preventing cardiovascular disease.\nIt is important to note that the effects of dietary salt reduction on cardiovascular biomarkers and hormone levels may vary depending on the individual's age, health status, and the degree of salt reduction. Additionally, some studies have suggested that a low-sodium diet may have different effects on cardiovascular health compared to a diet that is rich in potassium and other nutrients. Further research is needed to fully understand the effects of dietary salt reduction on cardiovascular health.",

            "gold_answer": "Evidence shows that reducing sodium intake to 66 mmol/d (mean reduction of 67%) reduces systolic blood pressure in adolescents and adults (age range 12 to 73) who were normotensive by 1.14 to 4.02 mmHg (all results on average) or hypertensive by 5.71 to 7.75 mmHg. Evidence also shows a reduction in diastolic blood pressure in people who were hypertensive by 2.68 to 2.91 mmHg; results for normotensive populations were imprecise. Certainty of the evidence varied according to the ethnicity of the population assessed: high certainty for white populations, moderate to low certainty for Asian populations, and low certainty for black populations. Reviewers identified concomitant increases in cholesterol (by 5.19 mg/dL), triglycerides (by 7.10 mg/dL), low\u2010density lipoprotein (by 2.46 mg/dL), aldosterone (by 101.98 pg/mL), noradrenaline (by 62.33 pg/mL), and adrenaline (by 7.55 pg/mL) with sodium reduction. It is worth noting that the duration of interventions was short (32% \u2264 1 week, 19% 1 week to 1 month, 7% \u2265 3 months); therefore the effects of sustained dietary salt reduction remain unclear.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "SYSTOLIC (systolic): top number in blood pressure; pressure during active contraction of the heart\nHYPERTENSION (hypertension): high blood pressure\nDIASTOLIC (diastolic): lower number in a blood pressure reading\nASSESS (assess): to learn about, measure, evaluate, look at\nCHOLESTEROL (cholesterol): The name for a group of blood fats. It includes LDL, or low-density lipoprotein, which is \u2018bad\u2019 cholesterol; HDL, or high-density lipoprotein, which is \u2018good\u2019 cholesterol; and triglycerides (TG). A high level of cholesterol in the blood is a major risk factor for heart attack and indirectly increases your risk of stroke.",

Lower blood pressure: A reduction in dietary salt intake can lead to a decrease in blood pressure in healthy normotensive individuals, which can help prevent the development of hypertension and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.\n2. Decrease albuminuria: Reducing dietary salt intake has been shown to decrease albuminuria, which is the presence of albumin in the urine, in healthy normotensive individuals.\n3. Lower renin and aldosterone levels: Dietary salt reduction has been found to decrease renin and aldosterone levels in healthy normotensive individuals. Renin and aldosterone are hormones that play a role in regulating blood pressure.\nIn hypertensive individuals, reducing dietary salt intake has been found to:\n1. Lower blood pressure: As in healthy normotensive individuals, reducing dietary salt intake can lower blood pressure in hypertensive individuals, which can help reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.\n2. Improve blood vessel function: Dietary salt reduction has been found to improve blood vessel function in hypertensive individuals, which can help reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.\n3. Decrease albuminuria: Reducing dietary salt intake has been shown to decrease albuminuria in hypertensive individuals, which can help prevent kidney damage.\n4. Lower renin and aldosterone levels: Dietary salt reduction has been found to decrease renin and aldosterone levels in hypertensive individuals, which can help reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.\nIt is important to note that the effects of dietary salt reduction on cardiovascular biomarkers and hormone levels may vary depending on the individual and their specific health status.

            "gold_answer": "Compared with chemotherapy in people with ALK\u2010rearranged NSCLC, ALK inhibitors (ALKis) improve overall survival, progression\u2010free survival, and quality of life. There may be fewer hematological, but more gastrointestinal grade 3 to 4 adverse events with ALKis. Compared with crizotinib, next\u2010generation ALKis improve progression\u2010free survival and probably improve overall survival and quality of life. There may be fewer grade 3 to 4 gastrointestinal adverse events and neutropenia with next\u2010generation ALKis. There may be little to no difference in grade 5 adverse events between types of ALKis. For people with ALK\u2010rearranged NSCLC, high\u2010certainty evidence shows that, compared with chemotherapy, targeted therapy with ALKis improves overall survival, progression\u2010free survival, and quality of life. ALKis probably improve the overall response rate (651 vs 267 per 1000 people; all results on average; moderate\u2010certainty evidence) and may result in little to no difference in all\u2010grade and grade 5 adverse events (low\u2010certainty evidence). Fewer people may experience fatigue (58 fewer per 1000 people; based on 1611 participants). Regarding specific grade 3 to 4 adverse events, compared with chemotherapy, more people with ALKis may experience nausea (18 more), diarrhea (20 more), and increased alanine aminotransferase (147 more). Fewer people may experience anemia (55 fewer), neutropenia (73 fewer), and thrombocytopenia (56 fewer). High\u2010certainty evidence shows that, compared with crizotinib, targeted therapy with next\u2010generation ALKis improves progression\u2010free survival. Next\u2010generation ALKis probably improve overall survival, overall response rate (888 vs 755 per 1000 people), and quality of life, with minimal to no effect on all\u2010grade adverse events (moderate\u2010certainty evidence) and grade 5 adverse events (low\u2010certainty evidence). Regarding specific all\u2010grade adverse events, compared with crizotinib, fewer people experience fatigue (51 fewer per 1000 people), loss of appetite (161 fewer), and edema (124 fewer), and more people have rash (63 more) with next\u2010generation ALKis. Regarding specific grade 3 to 4 adverse events, compared with crizotinib, fewer people experience nausea, vomiting, neutropenia (20, 18, 79 fewer, respectively), and more people have increased alanine aminotransferase (71 more) with next\u2010generation ALKis.",

            "gold_answer": "Compared with chemotherapy in people with ALK\u2010rearranged NSCLC, ALK inhibitors (ALKis) improve overall survival, progression\u2010free survival, and quality of life. There may be fewer hematological, but more gastrointestinal grade 3 to 4 adverse events with ALKis. Compared with crizotinib, next\u2010generation ALKis improve progression\u2010free survival and probably improve overall survival and quality of life. There may be fewer grade 3 to 4 gastrointestinal adverse events and neutropenia with next\u2010generation ALKis. There may be little to no difference in grade 5 adverse events between types of ALKis. For people with ALK\u2010rearranged NSCLC, high\u2010certainty evidence shows that, compared with chemotherapy, targeted therapy with ALKis improves overall survival, progression\u2010free survival, and quality of life. ALKis probably improve the overall response rate (651 vs 267 per 1000 people; all results on average; moderate\u2010certainty evidence) and may result in little to no difference in all\u2010grade and grade 5 adverse events (low\u2010certainty evidence). Fewer people may experience fatigue (58 fewer per 1000 people; based on 1611 participants). Regarding specific grade 3 to 4 adverse events, compared with chemotherapy, more people with ALKis may experience nausea (18 more), diarrhea (20 more), and increased alanine aminotransferase (147 more). Fewer people may experience anemia (55 fewer), neutropenia (73 fewer), and thrombocytopenia (56 fewer). High\u2010certainty evidence shows that, compared with crizotinib, targeted therapy with next\u2010generation ALKis improves progression\u2010free survival. Next\u2010generation ALKis probably improve overall survival, overall response rate (888 vs 755 per 1000 people), and quality of life, with minimal to no effect on all\u2010grade adverse events (moderate\u2010certainty evidence) and grade 5 adverse events (low\u2010certainty evidence). Regarding specific all\u2010grade adverse events, compared with crizotinib, fewer people experience fatigue (51 fewer per 1000 people), loss of appetite (161 fewer), and edema (124 fewer), and more people have rash (63 more) with next\u2010generation ALKis. Regarding specific grade 3 to 4 adverse events, compared with crizotinib, fewer people experience nausea, vomiting, neutropenia (20, 18, 79 fewer, respectively), and more people have increased alanine aminotransferase (71 more) with next\u2010generation ALKis.",

Improved overall survival: Targeted therapy has been shown to improve overall survival rates for patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC, compared to chemotherapy.\n2. Reduced risk of disease progression: Targeted therapy can help reduce the risk of disease progression and slow down the growth of cancer cells.\n3. Improved response rates: Targeted therapy can increase the response rates, meaning that the cancer shrinks or disappears, in patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC.\n4. Improved quality of life: Targeted therapy can help improve symptoms such as coughing, shortness of breath, and fatigue, which can improve the patient's overall quality of life.\n5. Fewer side effects: Targeted therapy can have fewer side effects compared to chemotherapy, as it targets specific cancer cells and not healthy cells.\nIt's important to note that the effectiveness of targeted therapy can vary depending on the specific ALK inhibitor used and the patient's individual response to the treatment. Additionally, targeted therapy may not be effective for all patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC, and other treatments such as chemotherapy or immunotherapy may be necessary. It's important for patients to discuss their treatment options with their healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for their individual situation.",

Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that can help maintain a healthy gut microbiome, which is important for the development and function of various bodily systems, including the immune system.\nStudies have found that probiotics can help reduce the risk of preterm birth, which is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Probiotics have also been shown to reduce the risk of other complications in preterm infants, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious condition that can cause damage to the intestines.\nIt's important to note that not all probiotics are the same, and some strains have been found to be more effective than others in preventing morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. For example, the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any supplements during pregnancy, including probiotics, to ensure safety and effectiveness. Additionally, it's important to note that while probiotics can help reduce the risk of complications, they are not a guarantee against them, and other factors such as proper prenatal care, a healthy diet, and a safe delivery are also important for a healthy pregnancy and baby.",
