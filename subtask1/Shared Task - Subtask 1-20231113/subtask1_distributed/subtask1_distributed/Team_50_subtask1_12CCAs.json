            "question": "What are the benefits and harms of primary thromboprophylaxis for ambulatory cancer patients receiving chemotherapy?",
            "gold_answer": "Primary prophylaxis with direct oral factor Xa inhibitors (direct oral anticoagulants; DOACs), low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), or ultra\u2010LMWH (uLMWH) reduced the incidence of thrombotic events compared with placebo or no prophylaxis in ambulatory cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, at the cost of greater risk of major and clinically relevant bleeding. Results were consistent in people with a range of cancer types and in a subgroup of people with breast cancer. Comparison of different types of prophylaxis in people with multiple myeloma showed that LMWH reduced the incidence of symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE), pulmonary embolism (PE), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) compared with aspirin and may lead to fewer people experiencing major bleeding. LMWH was also more effective than warfarin for reducing thrombotic events, but, as bleeding was not assessed, it is unclear how the benefits and harms of these treatments can best be balanced. Warfarin may be less effective than aspirin for reducing thrombotic events but may lead to fewer incidences of major bleeding. Primary prophylaxis versus placebo across different cancer types Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that DOACs may reduce the incidence of symptomatic VTE (19 vs 45 per 1000 people; all results on average), DVT (23 vs 45 per 1000 people), and PE (4 vs 12 per 1000 people) compared with placebo. It should be noted that differences between groups did not reach statistical significance. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that DOACs probably decrease the incidence of any VTE (49 vs 88 per 1000 people) but may increase the risk of major bleeding (17 vs 10 per 1000 people) and clinically relevant bleeding (48 vs 30 per 1000 people); differences between groups did not reach statistical significance for incidence of bleeding. Reviewers found no RCTs assessing mortality. Compared with no thromboprophylaxis, high\u2010 to moderate\u2010certainty evidence demonstrates similar effects on outcomes with LMWH or uLMWH compared with no prophylaxis. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that LMWH (bemiparin) may decrease one\u2010year overall mortality. Primary prophylaxis versus placebo or no thromboprophylaxis in people with breast cancer Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that warfarin may reduce symptomatic VTE (7 vs 44 per 1000 people) and DVT (3 vs 38 per 1000 people) but may increase the occurrence of major bleeding (48 vs 13 per 1000 people) compared with placebo or no thromboprophylaxis. It should be noted that differences between groups did not reach statistical significance for these outcomes. Very low\u2010certainty evidence means that no conclusions could be drawn regarding symptomatic PE; any VTE, clinically relevant bleeding, and mortality were not assessed. Different types of primary prophylaxis versus each other in people with multiple myeloma Compared with aspirin, moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that LMWH probably reduces the incidence of symptomatic VTE, PE, and DVT. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests LMWH may lead to fewer people experiencing major bleeding. Compared with warfarin, LMWH reduces the incidence of symptomatic VTE (high\u2010certainty evidence) and DVT (moderate\u2010certainty evidence) and may reduce symptomatic PE (low\u2010certainty evidence). Bleeding was not assessed. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence from a single RCT shows that more people taking warfarin than aspirin developed symptomatic VTE and DVT, although differences between groups did not reach statistical significance. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows little to no difference between groups in rates of symptomatic PE. Low\u2010certainty results suggest that fewer people taking warfarin than aspirin experienced major bleeding (2 vs 13 per 1000 people), although, again, differences between groups did not reach statistical significance.",

            "question": "What are the benefits and harms of primary thromboprophylaxis for ambulatory cancer patients receiving chemotherapy?",
            "gold_answer": "Primary prophylaxis with direct oral factor Xa inhibitors (direct oral anticoagulants; DOACs), low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), or ultra\u2010LMWH (uLMWH) reduced the incidence of thrombotic events compared with placebo or no prophylaxis in ambulatory cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, at the cost of greater risk of major and clinically relevant bleeding. Results were consistent in people with a range of cancer types and in a subgroup of people with breast cancer. Comparison of different types of prophylaxis in people with multiple myeloma showed that LMWH reduced the incidence of symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE), pulmonary embolism (PE), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) compared with aspirin and may lead to fewer people experiencing major bleeding. LMWH was also more effective than warfarin for reducing thrombotic events, but, as bleeding was not assessed, it is unclear how the benefits and harms of these treatments can best be balanced. Warfarin may be less effective than aspirin for reducing thrombotic events but may lead to fewer incidences of major bleeding. Primary prophylaxis versus placebo across different cancer types Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that DOACs may reduce the incidence of symptomatic VTE (19 vs 45 per 1000 people; all results on average), DVT (23 vs 45 per 1000 people), and PE (4 vs 12 per 1000 people) compared with placebo. It should be noted that differences between groups did not reach statistical significance. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that DOACs probably decrease the incidence of any VTE (49 vs 88 per 1000 people) but may increase the risk of major bleeding (17 vs 10 per 1000 people) and clinically relevant bleeding (48 vs 30 per 1000 people); differences between groups did not reach statistical significance for incidence of bleeding. Reviewers found no RCTs assessing mortality. Compared with no thromboprophylaxis, high\u2010 to moderate\u2010certainty evidence demonstrates similar effects on outcomes with LMWH or uLMWH compared with no prophylaxis. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that LMWH (bemiparin) may decrease one\u2010year overall mortality. Primary prophylaxis versus placebo or no thromboprophylaxis in people with breast cancer Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that warfarin may reduce symptomatic VTE (7 vs 44 per 1000 people) and DVT (3 vs 38 per 1000 people) but may increase the occurrence of major bleeding (48 vs 13 per 1000 people) compared with placebo or no thromboprophylaxis. It should be noted that differences between groups did not reach statistical significance for these outcomes. Very low\u2010certainty evidence means that no conclusions could be drawn regarding symptomatic PE; any VTE, clinically relevant bleeding, and mortality were not assessed. Different types of primary prophylaxis versus each other in people with multiple myeloma Compared with aspirin, moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that LMWH probably reduces the incidence of symptomatic VTE, PE, and DVT. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests LMWH may lead to fewer people experiencing major bleeding. Compared with warfarin, LMWH reduces the incidence of symptomatic VTE (high\u2010certainty evidence) and DVT (moderate\u2010certainty evidence) and may reduce symptomatic PE (low\u2010certainty evidence). Bleeding was not assessed. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence from a single RCT shows that more people taking warfarin than aspirin developed symptomatic VTE and DVT, although differences between groups did not reach statistical significance. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows little to no difference between groups in rates of symptomatic PE. Low\u2010certainty results suggest that fewer people taking warfarin than aspirin experienced major bleeding (2 vs 13 per 1000 people), although, again, differences between groups did not reach statistical significance.",

The benefits of primary thromboprophylaxis include:\n* Reduced risk of developing blood clots, which can be life-threatening in some cases\n* Reduced risk of pulmonary embolism, a potentially fatal complication of blood clots\n* Reduced risk of cancer recurrence, as some studies suggest that blood clots may increase the risk of cancer recurrence\n* Improved quality of life for patients who are at high risk of developing blood clots\nHowever, there are also potential harms associated with primary thromboprophylaxis, including:\n* Increased risk of bleeding, which can be dangerous in some cases\n* Increased risk of bleeding complications, such as hematuria (blood in the urine) or gastrointestinal bleeding\n* Increased risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, a condition in which the blood thinner heparin causes a low platelet count\n* Increased risk of osteoporosis, as some blood thinners can lead to bone loss over time\n* Increased financial burden, as blood thinners can be expensive\nIt's important to note that the benefits and harms of primary thromboprophylaxis can vary depending on the individual patient and their specific medical history, cancer type, and treatment regimen. Patients should discuss their individual risk factors and the potential benefits and harms of primary thromboprophylaxis with their healthcare provider to determine whether it is appropriate for them.",

However, no clear conclusions can be drawn when CPAP is compared with supportive care. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that, compared with assisted ventilation, prophylactic CPAP probably reduces by nearly half infants who require mechanical ventilation (494 vs 1000 per 1000 infants; all results on average) and probably reduces rates of bronchopulmonary dysplasia at 36 weeks (394 vs 443 per 1000 infants), rates of neonatal death (143 vs 175 per 1000 infants), and rates of death or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (479 vs 541 per 1000 infants). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that CPAP, compared with mechanical ventilation, may reduce the use of surfactant (589 vs 989 per 1000 infants) but does not seem to impact intraventricular hemorrhage, neurodevelopment impairment, or retinopathy. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows little to no difference between groups for bronchopulmonary dysplasia at 36 weeks and neonatal death at any time. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that, compared with supportive care, CPAP may reduce the use of surfactant (163 vs 217 per 1000 infants). However, results for other outcomes are of very low certainty (failed treatment) or are imprecise (death or bronchopulmonary dysplasia, pneumothorax, intraventricular hemorrhage, or retinopathy of prematurity grade 3 or 4).",

Reduced malaria-related morbidity and mortality: By reducing the number of malaria cases, MDA can also reduce the number of malaria-related complications, such as anemia, seizures, and deaths.\n3. Reduced risk of drug resistance: MDA can help reduce the risk of drug resistance by ensuring that a large proportion of the population is treated with effective antimalarial drugs, reducing the selective pressure that drives the emergence of resistant parasites.\n4. Reduced transmission: MDA can reduce the transmission of malaria parasites from person to person, as individuals who are infected with malaria are less likely to transmit the parasite to others if they are treated effectively.\n5. Reduced economic burden: Malaria can have a significant economic impact on individuals, families, and communities. MDA can help reduce the economic burden of malaria by reducing the number of cases and the associated healthcare costs.\nIt is important to note that MDA should be implemented in conjunction with other malaria control measures, such as insecticide-treated bed nets, indoor residual spraying, and vector control measures, to maximize its effectiveness. Additionally, MDA should be carried out under the supervision of trained healthcare professionals, and in accordance with national treatment guidelines and safety protocols.",

            "gold_answer": "For adults with late\u2010stage Chagas disease, treatment with benznidazole may result in better clearance of antibody titers and parasitemia than placebo; however, adverse effects may be more common. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that benznidazole (at 5 mg/kg twice a day for 30 days, or 300 mg/d for 40 to 80 days) was more effective than placebo for clearing or reducing antibody titers at one, two, and five years (at five years, 546 vs 439 per 1000 people had titers). Benznidazole may also result in better clearance of parasitemia (very low\u2010certainty evidence). However, little to no difference was reported between benznidazole and placebo for remission of heart failure or sustained ventricular tachycardias. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence from one very large RCT indicates that more people experienced adverse effects in the form of rashes, gastrointestinal symptoms, and peripheral neuropathy with benznidazole (on average, 239 vs 95 per 1000 people). Reviewers found no studies assessing quality of life nor pathological demonstration of parasites.",

In a large, randomized controlled trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine, benznidazole was associated with significant improvements in clinical outcomes, including reduced risk of disease progression, improved quality of life, and decreased parasitemia. The benefits of benznidazole were observed in both seropositive and seronegative patients. However, the study also found that benznidazole was associated with a higher risk of adverse events, including gastrointestinal symptoms and neuropsychiatric disorders. Overall, the benefits of benznidazole appear to outweigh the risks for adults with late-stage, symptomatic Chagas disease, particularly those with severe disease.",

            "gold_answer": "For adults with late\u2010stage Chagas disease, treatment with benznidazole may result in better clearance of antibody titers and parasitemia than placebo; however, adverse effects may be more common. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that benznidazole (at 5 mg/kg twice a day for 30 days, or 300 mg/d for 40 to 80 days) was more effective than placebo for clearing or reducing antibody titers at one, two, and five years (at five years, 546 vs 439 per 1000 people had titers). Benznidazole may also result in better clearance of parasitemia (very low\u2010certainty evidence). However, little to no difference was reported between benznidazole and placebo for remission of heart failure or sustained ventricular tachycardias. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence from one very large RCT indicates that more people experienced adverse effects in the form of rashes, gastrointestinal symptoms, and peripheral neuropathy with benznidazole (on average, 239 vs 95 per 1000 people). Reviewers found no studies assessing quality of life nor pathological demonstration of parasites.",

While it is effective in treating the acute phase of the disease, its effectiveness in treating late-stage, symptomatic Chagas disease is still being studied.\nAccording to a Cochrane review published in 2018, there is limited evidence comparing benznidazole with placebo for the treatment of late-stage, symptomatic Chagas disease in adults. The review found only one randomized controlled trial that met the inclusion criteria, and the results suggested that benznidazole may be effective in improving symptoms and reducing the risk of disease progression in some patients.\nHowever, the review also noted that the quality of the evidence was low due to the small sample size and methodological limitations of the trial. Therefore, more research is needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of benznidazole for this indication.\nIt's important to note that Chagas disease is a complex and heterogeneous disease, and treatment outcomes can vary depending on the severity and location of the infection, as well as the individual patient's health status and response to treatment. Therefore, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the best course of treatment for each patient.",

However, iron deficiency is also a significant public health problem worldwide, particularly in developing countries. Fortifying salt with iron in addition to iodine can help address both issues simultaneously.\nStudies have shown that fortification of salt with iron and iodine can significantly improve both iron and iodine status in populations. For example, a study published in the Journal of Nutrition found that children who received iron-fortified salt had higher levels of hemoglobin and iron in their blood compared to those who received iodized salt only. Another study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that adults who consumed iron-fortified salt had higher levels of iron in their blood and a lower prevalence of iron deficiency compared to those who consumed iodized salt only.\nIt is important to note that the effectiveness of fortification may vary depending on the population, the level of fortification, and other factors such as dietary habits and nutrient deficiencies. Therefore, it is important to monitor the effectiveness of fortification programs and adjust them as needed.\nIn summary, fortification of salt with iron and iodine is a more effective way to improve both iron and iodine status in children, adolescents, and adults compared to fortification with iodine alone.",

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers identified 31 modeling studies that simulated COVID\u201019 outbreak scenarios. Scenarios suggest that the introduction of international travel restrictions potentially reduces the number of imported/exported cases (by 18% to 99%), the number of cases in the community (by 1.8% to 98%), mortality (by 4% to 98%), time to COVID\u201019 outbreak (by < 1 day to 85 days), the number/proportion of cases at peak (by 0.3% to 8%), and growth acceleration of epidemic progression (by 6%). Results for the impact of international travel restrictions on the effective reproduction (R) number and risk of outbreak were mixed, and effect estimates were not available for risk of importation/exportation. Reviewers rated all evidence as low to very low certainty, so no firm conclusions can be drawn.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "INTERNAL (internal): within the body\nPOTENTIAL (potential): possible\nPOTENTIATE (potentiate): increase or multiply the effect of a drug or toxin (poison) by giving another drug or toxin at the same time (sometimes an unintentional result)\nPOTENTIATOR (potentiator): an agent that helps another agent work better\nMORTALITY (mortality): death\nRISK (risk): The chance that an activity or hazard will give rise to harm. Risk is generally given in terms of numerical odds (1 in 10) or percentages (10%).",

            "llm_answer": "International travel restrictions have had a significant impact on the spread of COVID-19, slowing down the spread of the virus and giving countries time to prepare and respond to outbreaks. Restrictions such as suspending international travel, closing borders, and imposing quarantines have helped to reduce the number of cases and deaths, particularly in countries with weak healthcare systems. However, such restrictions have also had economic and social costs, including disruptions to supply chains, loss of tourism revenue, and separation of families. Additionally, the effectiveness of travel restrictions in controlling the spread of COVID-19 has been variable, as some countries have continued to experience outbreaks despite strict measures, while others have been able to contain the virus with more limited restrictions.",

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers identified 31 modeling studies that simulated COVID\u201019 outbreak scenarios. Scenarios suggest that the introduction of international travel restrictions potentially reduces the number of imported/exported cases (by 18% to 99%), the number of cases in the community (by 1.8% to 98%), mortality (by 4% to 98%), time to COVID\u201019 outbreak (by < 1 day to 85 days), the number/proportion of cases at peak (by 0.3% to 8%), and growth acceleration of epidemic progression (by 6%). Results for the impact of international travel restrictions on the effective reproduction (R) number and risk of outbreak were mixed, and effect estimates were not available for risk of importation/exportation. Reviewers rated all evidence as low to very low certainty, so no firm conclusions can be drawn.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "INTERNAL (internal): within the body\nPOTENTIAL (potential): possible\nPOTENTIATE (potentiate): increase or multiply the effect of a drug or toxin (poison) by giving another drug or toxin at the same time (sometimes an unintentional result)\nPOTENTIATOR (potentiator): an agent that helps another agent work better\nMORTALITY (mortality): death\nRISK (risk): The chance that an activity or hazard will give rise to harm. Risk is generally given in terms of numerical odds (1 in 10) or percentages (10%).",

It's important to discuss the potential benefits and harms with a healthcare professional to determine if a local corticosteroid injection is the best course of treatment for your specific case of carpal tunnel syndrome.

            "gold_answer": "For women with suspected or confirmed gynecological cancers, moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that probably fewer women had nausea and vomiting with ERAS programs (education and counseling, preoperative fasting and carbohydrate treatment, early feeding, and mobilization after the operation, prevention of hypothermia, nausea, and vomiting) than with traditional care (86 vs 165 per 1000 women; all results on average). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that ERAS programs may reduce the number of women experiencing overall postoperative complications within 30 days of operation (235 vs 329 per 1000 women), although the result did not reach statistical significance, and may reduce readmissions within 30 days of operation (72 vs 161 per 1000 women). ERAS programs may also reduce hospital stay (\u22121.7 days), time to first flatus (\u22120.8 days), and time to first defecation (\u22121.0 days). Evidence on participant satisfaction and mortality at 30 days is very uncertain.",

            "llm_answer": "Perioperative enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) is a multimodal approach that aims to optimize surgical outcomes and reduce complications. In women with suspected or confirmed gynecological cancers, ERAS has several benefits, including:\nBenefits:\n1. Reduced postoperative complications: ERAS protocols have been shown to decrease the risk of surgical site infections, urinary tract infections, and respiratory complications.\n2. Faster recovery: ERAS pathways are designed to minimize the impact of surgery on the body, leading to faster recovery times and reduced length of hospital stays.\n3. Improved pain management: ERAS protocols emphasize the use of evidence-based pain management strategies, resulting in better pain control and reduced opioid consumption.\n4. Enhanced patient education: ERAS programs provide comprehensive patient education, empowering women to take an active role in their recovery and improving their overall experience.\n5. Cost savings: By reducing complications and length of stay, ERAS can lead to cost savings for both patients and healthcare systems.\nHowever, there are also potential harms associated with ERAS in women with gynecological cancers, including:\nHarms:\n1. Inadequate pain management: If not properly implemented, ERAS protocols may not provide adequate pain management, leading to increased patient discomfort and dissatisfaction.\n2. Increased risk of recurrence: Some studies suggest that ERAS may increase the risk of cancer recurrence due to the omission of traditional surgical techniques and adjuvant therapies.\n3. Inadequate monitoring: ERAS protocols may not include adequate monitoring for signs of recurrence or complications, potentially leading to delayed diagnosis and treatment.\n4. Increased risk of bleeding: ERAS protocols may reduce the use of blood transfusions, which can increase the risk of bleeding in patients with gynecological cancers.\n5. Inadequate addressing of psychological and emotional needs: ERAS programs may not fully address the psychological and emotional needs of women with gynecological cancers, potentially leading to increased anxiety and depression",

            "gold_answer": "For women with suspected or confirmed gynecological cancers, moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that probably fewer women had nausea and vomiting with ERAS programs (education and counseling, preoperative fasting and carbohydrate treatment, early feeding, and mobilization after the operation, prevention of hypothermia, nausea, and vomiting) than with traditional care (86 vs 165 per 1000 women; all results on average). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that ERAS programs may reduce the number of women experiencing overall postoperative complications within 30 days of operation (235 vs 329 per 1000 women), although the result did not reach statistical significance, and may reduce readmissions within 30 days of operation (72 vs 161 per 1000 women). ERAS programs may also reduce hospital stay (\u22121.7 days), time to first flatus (\u22120.8 days), and time to first defecation (\u22121.0 days). Evidence on participant satisfaction and mortality at 30 days is very uncertain.",

The benefits of ERAS for women with suspected or confirmed gynecological cancers include:\nBenefits:\n1. Reduced postoperative complications: ERAS protocols are designed to minimize the risk of complications such as nausea, vomiting, and pain after surgery, which can help reduce the length of hospital stay and improve overall recovery.\n2. Faster recovery: ERAS pathways emphasize early mobilization, adequate pain management, and minimizing the use of opioids, which can help patients recover faster and return to their normal activities sooner.\n3. Improved patient satisfaction: Women undergoing gynecological cancer surgery may experience less anxiety and discomfort when they are well-informed and involved in their care. ERAS programs often include patient education and involvement in the recovery process, leading to higher patient satisfaction.\n4. Cost savings: By reducing the length of hospital stays and minimizing complications, ERAS can help reduce healthcare costs associated with surgical care.\nHarms:\n1. Inadequate pain management: While ERAS aims to minimize the use of opioids, inadequate pain management can be a concern for some patients, particularly those with more advanced cancers or those undergoing more complex surgical procedures.\n2. Increased risk of complications: ERAS protocols may not be suitable for all patients, and some may experience complications such as bleeding, infection, or adhesions. These risks may be higher for patients with more aggressive or advanced cancers.\n3. Delayed diagnosis: In some cases, the focus on rapid recovery may lead to a delay in the diagnosis of complications or recurrences, which can negatively impact patient outcomes.\n4. Inadequate patient selection: Not all patients with gynecological cancers are suitable candidates for ERAS, and inadequate patient selection can lead to adverse outcomes.\nIn summary, while ERAS offers several benefits for women with suspected or confirmed gynecological can",

Moderate\u2010quality evidence showed that this benefit was not sustained in the longer\u2010term (5 years). Low\u2010quality evidence suggests there was no benefit of an adjunctive corticosteroid in terms of reducing rates of disabling neurological deficit, ether within 24 months or at 5 years. There was no apparent impact of adjunctive corticosteroids on the incidences of hepatitis, hyperglycemia/glycosuria, gastrointestinal bleeding, or invasive bacterial infection but event rates were very low meaning conclusions cannot be drawn.",

Studies have consistently demonstrated that corticosteroids reduce the risk of death and disability in patients with tuberculous meningitis, particularly in those with severe disease. The use of corticosteroids has been associated with a significant reduction in mortality rates, from approximately 30-40% in untreated patients to around 10-20% in patients receiving corticosteroids. Additionally, corticosteroids have been shown to reduce the risk of long-term disability, such as hearing loss and cognitive impairment. However, the optimal dosage and duration of corticosteroid therapy for tuberculous meningitis are still uncertain and require further research.",

Moderate\u2010quality evidence showed that this benefit was not sustained in the longer\u2010term (5 years). Low\u2010quality evidence suggests there was no benefit of an adjunctive corticosteroid in terms of reducing rates of disabling neurological deficit, ether within 24 months or at 5 years. There was no apparent impact of adjunctive corticosteroids on the incidences of hepatitis, hyperglycemia/glycosuria, gastrointestinal bleeding, or invasive bacterial infection but event rates were very low meaning conclusions cannot be drawn.",

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers found no conclusive RCT evidence suggesting that administration of probiotics to pregnant women was superior or inferior to placebo in reducing morbidity or mortality in preterm infants. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that in pregnant women who received probiotics, the risk of preterm birth (< 37 weeks) and miscarriage/stillbirth was no more or less likely compared with those who did not receive probiotics. Only one RCT (159 infants) reported no incidences of early neonatal sepsis (\u2264 3 days) in either trial arm. For most outcomes, event rates were very low or there were no events in both arms. There is a lack of data on neonatal short\u2010term (early or late sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, neonatal death, hospital stay) and long\u2010term (major neurodevelopmental disability) potential benefits or harms following probiotic administration. None of the trials included women with a previous history of preterm birth, multiple pregnancy, or uterine anomaly. Reviewers did not assess serious adverse maternal or neonatal adverse events following use of probiotics.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "RCT (rct): A study which tests the effectiveness and safety of treatments or procedures as fairly and objectively as possible. By randomly assigning patients to different treatments for the same problem, the results can be assessed equally with the aim of discovering the best possible procedure for the condition.\nPLACEBO (placebo): an inactive substance; a pill/liquid that contains no medicine\nMORBIDITY (morbidity): undesired result or complication\nMORTALITY (mortality): death\nRISK (risk): The chance that an activity or hazard will give rise to harm. Risk is generally given in terms of numerical odds (1 in 10) or percentages (10%).\nSEPSIS (sepsis): The immune system's overreaction to an infection or injury which can lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and death.\nPOTENTIAL (potential): possible\nPOTENTIATE (potentiate): increase or multiply the effect of a drug or toxin (poison) by giving another drug or toxin at the same time (sometimes an unintentional result)\nPOTENTIATOR (potentiator): an agent that helps another agent work better\nASSESS (assess): to learn about, measure, evaluate, look at",

            "llm_answer": "Yes, probiotics administered to pregnant women have been shown to help prevent morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that can help maintain a healthy gut microbiome, which is important for the development and function of various bodily systems, including the immune system.\nStudies have found that probiotics can help reduce the risk of preterm birth, which is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Probiotics have also been shown to reduce the risk of other complications in preterm infants, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious condition that can cause damage to the intestines.\nIt's important to note that not all probiotics are the same, and some strains have been found to be more effective than others in preventing morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. For example, the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any supplements during pregnancy, including probiotics, to ensure safety and effectiveness. Additionally, it's important to note that while probiotics can help reduce the risk of complications, they are not a guarantee against them, and other factors such as proper prenatal care, a healthy diet, and a safe delivery are also important for a healthy pregnancy and baby.",
