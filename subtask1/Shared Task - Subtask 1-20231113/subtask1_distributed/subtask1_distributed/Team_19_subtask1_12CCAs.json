            "gold_answer": "For people with pNETs, high\u2010certainty evidence shows higher disease control rates with surufatinib than with placebo after a year (74% vs 59%; all results on average), while single therapy with everolimus with or without a somatostatin analog (SSA) likely achieved the highest disease control rates after 12 months (rates ranged from 80% to 84% vs 55% to 65%) based on moderate\u2010certainty evidence. The lowest hazard for progression was found with interferon plus an SSA (very low\u2010certainty evidence; 15 vs 5 months) followed by everolimus, sunitinib, and SSAs (all moderate\u2010certainty evidence, 11 to 12 vs 4 to 6 months), and high\u2010certainty evidence shows better progression\u2010free survival with surufatinib than with placebo (11 vs 5 months). SSAs achieved the greatest effect on the quality of life. Sunitinib and surufatinib showed the highest numbers of grade 1 to 4 adverse events per person and serious adverse events (grade 3 or 4) per person, whereas SSAs had the lowest numbers in both cases (evidence not GRADEd for these outcomes).",

            "llm_answer": "There is limited research comparing different therapies with placebo and with each other in people with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs). However, some studies suggest that certain therapies may have benefits in terms of tumor control and symptom management.\nFor example, somatostatin analogs, such as octreotide and lanreotide, have been shown to be effective in controlling symptoms such as diarrhea, flushing, and abdominal pain in patients with pNETs. These therapies work by mimicking the action of somatostatin, a hormone that regulates the release of other hormones and can inhibit the growth of certain tumors.\nOther therapies that have been studied in pNETs include chemotherapy, targeted therapies, and immunotherapy. Chemotherapy, such as streptozocin and fluorouracil, can be effective in controlling tumor growth and improving survival in some patients with pNETs. Targeted therapies, such as everolimus and sunitinib, can also be effective in controlling tumor growth and have been approved for use in patients with advanced pNETs. Immunotherapy, such as checkpoint inhibitors, has shown promise in treating pNETs, but more research is needed to determine its effectiveness.\nIt's important to note that the most effective therapy for a patient with pNETs will depend on the specific characteristics of their tumor, such as the type and location of the tumor, as well as the patient's overall health and preferences. It's important for patients with pNETs to discuss their treatment options with their healthcare provider and consider enrolling in clinical trials to access new and innovative therapies.",

Studies did not use a common threshold. Reviewers used three prespecified levels of specificity (65%, 75%, and 85%; corresponding sensitivities are 80%, 73%, and 62%, respectively; all further results on average) to calculate the number of people who may be misclassified by serum ferritin. For every 1000 people tested, at a prevalence of 42% and a specificity of 65%, 204 people could be wrongly diagnosed with iron overload and 85 cases could be missed. At 75% specificity, the numbers could be 146 and 113 people, respectively. At 85% specificity, the numbers could be 87 and 159 people, respectively.",

            "gold_answer": "For adults who were inpatients, attended outpatient departments, or who lived in community settings (all studies included a mix of healthy and non\u2010healthy adults), average sensitivities for serum ferritin ranged from 0% to 100% (19/36 estimates \u2265 80%), and specificities, when estimable, ranged from 0% to 100% (10/29 estimates \u2265 90%). Studies did not use a common threshold. Reviewers used three prespecified levels of specificity (65%, 75%, and 85%; corresponding sensitivities are 80%, 73%, and 62%, respectively; all further results on average) to calculate the number of people who may be misclassified by serum ferritin. For every 1000 people tested, at a prevalence of 42% and a specificity of 65%, 204 people could be wrongly diagnosed with iron overload and 85 cases could be missed. At 75% specificity, the numbers could be 146 and 113 people, respectively. At 85% specificity, the numbers could be 87 and 159 people, respectively.",

            "llm_answer": "Ferritin is a commonly used marker for iron overload in adults, but its accuracy can vary depending on certain factors.\nIn healthy individuals, ferritin levels are generally low, ranging from 15-100 ng/mL. However, in individuals with iron overload, ferritin levels can be significantly elevated, often above 1000 ng/mL.\nStudies have shown that ferritin levels can accurately reflect iron stores in the body, with a high degree of correlation between ferritin levels and iron stores. However, there are certain conditions where ferritin levels may not accurately reflect iron stores, such as in chronic inflammation, chronic kidney disease, and certain malignancies.\nAdditionally, ferritin levels can be affected by other factors such as age, gender, and medications. For example, older adults may have lower ferritin levels than younger adults, and women may have lower ferritin levels than men due to menstruation and pregnancy. Certain medications, such as anemia medications, can also affect ferritin levels.\nTherefore, while ferritin is a useful marker for iron overload, it should be interpreted with caution and in conjunction with other diagnostic tests, such as serum iron and transferrin saturation, to ensure accurate diagnosis and treatment.\nIn summary, the accuracy of ferritin as a marker of iron overload in adults is generally high, but it can be affected by various factors, and should be interpreted with caution and in conjunction with other diagnostic tests.",

            "gold_answer": "Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that platinum therapy improves survival, with manageable reported toxicity rates. Therefore, it is a treatment option for all patients with triple\u2010negative breast cancer. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows a small improvement in overall survival with platinum\u2010containing regimens compared with non\u2010platinum regimens (on average, 1 year risk of death 455 vs 510 per 1000 women). Women receiving platinum drugs also may have a lesser chance of cancer progression at one year (on average, 880 vs 936 progressions per 1000 women), but the certainty of evidence was very low. Tumor responses to treatment were more likely for women receiving platinum treatment (on average, 475 vs 340 per 1000 women; low\u2010certainty evidence). Researchers examined many different treatment combinations, and the addition of any platinum therapy to other treatments did increase known adverse events such as anemia, nausea, and vomiting (low\u2010certainty evidence). However, study authors noted no increase in the number of women ceasing therapy due to adverse events when platinum was part of the regimen. The risk of death due to chemotherapy treatment was low and was not higher for women receiving platinum therapy. No trials reported quality of life data. Trial results show that some subgroups, such as women with a heritable mutation in BRCA1/BRCA2 , may benefit from platinum more than others. Evidence from five RCTs suggests that cancer was less likely to progress at one year in this group than in other patients receiving platinum therapy. It is not known whether these are the only patients with triple\u2010negative breast cancer who benefit from platinum therapy, as most trials have not assessed the BRCA1/2 status of trial participants. Evidence suggests improved survival, whether platinum treatment was given as first\u2010, second\u2010, or third\u2010line therapy, with a trend toward greater benefit for its use as second\u2010 or third\u2010line treatment.",

However, it's important to note that the choice of chemotherapy regimen depends on various factors, including the patient's overall health, tumor characteristics, and previous treatment history.\nA systematic review and meta-analysis published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in 2018 compared the efficacy and safety of platinum-containing regimens with non-platinum chemotherapy regimens in patients with TNBC. The analysis included 17 randomized controlled trials that involved a total of 4,644 patients.\nThe results showed that platinum-containing regimens were associated with a significant improvement in overall survival compared to non-platinum regimens (hazard ratio = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.77-0.92). Additionally, platinum-containing regimens were found to be more effective in achieving objective response rates (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS) compared to non-platinum regimens.\nHowever, it's important to note that the benefit of platinum-containing regimens was mainly observed in patients with basal-like TNBC, which is a subset of TNBC that is characterized by a high expression of basal markers and a low expression of luminal markers. In contrast, non-basal-like TNBC did not seem to benefit from platinum-containing regimens.\nIn terms of safety, platinum-containing regimens were associated with a higher risk of adverse events, such as nausea, vomiting, and neurotoxicity, compared to non-platinum regimens.\nIn summary, platinum-containing regimens may be a viable option for women with triple-negative metastatic breast cancer, particularly those with basal-like TNBC.

Other outcomes were similar with both interventions. In children hospitalized with bronchiolitis, moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that, compared with enteral fluid feeding, parenteral fluid therapy provided no difference in length of hospital stay or duration of time requiring non\u2010oral fluid therapy. Success of insertion on the first attempt was higher with enteral tube feeding than intravenous fluid (on average 851 vs 561 per 1000 children; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). A lower proportion of children receiving enteral fluid required change in modality of fluid therapy (on average 131 vs 251 per 1000 children). There was no evidence of a difference in local complications or parental satisfaction.",

            "llm_answer": "Parenteral fluid therapy involves administering fluids and medications through a vein, while enteral fluid therapy involves feeding a patient through a tube that is placed in the stomach or small intestine.\nFor children hospitalized with bronchiolitis, enteral fluid therapy is generally preferred over parenteral fluid therapy because it is associated with fewer complications and better outcomes. Enteral fluid therapy allows for the delivery of nutrients and fluids directly to the gut, which can help maintain gut function and reduce the risk of gut injury. Additionally, enteral fluid therapy may be better tolerated than parenteral fluid therapy, which can cause discomfort, pain, and infection.\nHowever, in some cases, parenteral fluid therapy may be necessary, such as when a child is unable to tolerate enteral feeding or has severe dehydration that requires rapid fluid resuscitation. In these situations, parenteral fluid therapy may be used temporarily until the child can transition to enteral feeding.\nOverall, the choice between parenteral and enteral fluid therapy for children hospitalized with bronchiolitis depends on the individual child's needs and clinical condition. A healthcare professional will assess the child's condition and make a decision based on their clinical judgment and the child's response to treatment.",

            "gold_answer": "Enteral fluid therapy is a better option than parenteral for children with difficult intravenous access since it provides higher first insertion attempt success and reduces the need to change to the other modality. Other outcomes were similar with both interventions. In children hospitalized with bronchiolitis, moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that, compared with enteral fluid feeding, parenteral fluid therapy provided no difference in length of hospital stay or duration of time requiring non\u2010oral fluid therapy. Success of insertion on the first attempt was higher with enteral tube feeding than intravenous fluid (on average 851 vs 561 per 1000 children; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). A lower proportion of children receiving enteral fluid required change in modality of fluid therapy (on average 131 vs 251 per 1000 children). There was no evidence of a difference in local complications or parental satisfaction.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "PARENTERAL (parenteral): given by injection\nINTRAVENOUS (intravenous): through the vein\nLOCALIZED (localized): restricted to one area, limited to one area\nCOMPLICATIONS (complications): Problems that develop after an operation, treatment or illness.",

            "llm_answer": "Parenteral and enteral fluid therapy are both used to manage fluid and electrolyte imbalances in children hospitalized with bronchiolitis. Parenteral fluid therapy involves administering fluids and electrolytes intravenously, while enteral fluid therapy involves feeding the child fluids and electrolytes through a tube that is inserted into the stomach or small intestine.\nBoth methods have their advantages and disadvantages. Parenteral fluid therapy is often used in children who are unable to drink enough fluids orally or have severe dehydration, as it allows for rapid rehydration and electrolyte replacement. However, it can also lead to complications such as infection, thrombophlebitis, and electrolyte imbalances.\nEnteral fluid therapy, on the other hand, is associated with fewer complications and is generally considered to be more physiologic, as it mimics the natural process of feeding. However, it may not be as effective in rapidly rehydrating the child as parenteral fluid therapy, and may require longer administration times.\nThe choice between parenteral and enteral fluid therapy for children hospitalized with bronchiolitis depends on the severity of the illness, the child's age and overall health, and the presence of any comorbidities. In general, enteral fluid therapy is preferred in children who are able to tolerate oral feedings, while parenteral fluid therapy may be used in children who are severely dehydrated or have other complications. Ultimately, the decision should be made on a case-by-case basis, with careful monitoring and close collaboration between healthcare providers.",

The theory behind this technique is that the injury stimulates the release of chemical signals that help the embryo implant in the uterus.\nThere is some evidence to suggest that intentional endometrial injury may improve the success rates of in vitro fertilization (IVF) and other assisted reproductive technologies. However, it is important to note that the scientific evidence supporting this technique is limited and inconclusive.\nA 2018 systematic review and meta-analysis published in the journal Fertility and Sterility found that endometrial scratching may improve the live birth rate in women undergoing IVF, but the quality of the evidence was low. Another study published in the Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics in 2019 found that endometrial biopsy may improve the implantation rate in women undergoing frozen embryo transfer, but the sample size was small and the results were not statistically significant.\nIt is important to note that intentional endometrial injury is not a standard treatment for infertility and should only be performed under the guidance of a qualified healthcare provider. Additionally, it is not recommended for women with a history of recurrent pregnancy loss or those with a low ovarian reserve.\nIn summary, while there is some evidence to suggest that intentional endometrial injury may improve the success rates of assisted reproductive technologies, the scientific evidence is limited and inconclusive. It is important to discuss the risks and benefits of this technique with a qualified healthcare provider before undergoing any treatment.",

However, they have different approaches to preventing postoperative pancreatic fistula, which is a potential complication that can occur when the pancreas is injured during surgery.\nDuct-to-mucosa pancreaticojejunostomy involves attaching the pancreatic duct to the mucosa of the small intestine, creating a watertight connection that helps prevent pancreatic juice from leaking into the abdominal cavity. This technique has been shown to reduce the risk of postoperative pancreatic fistula compared to other techniques.\nInvagination pancreaticojejunostomy, on the other hand, involves invaginating the pancreatic tissue into the lumen of the small intestine, creating a tube-like structure that allows pancreatic juice to flow directly into the small intestine. This technique has also been shown to reduce the risk of postoperative pancreatic fistula.\nBoth techniques have their advantages and disadvantages, and the choice between them depends on various factors, such as the patient's individual anatomy and the surgeon's experience and preference. Some studies suggest that duct-to-mucosa pancreaticojejunostomy may have a lower risk of postoperative pancreatic fistula compared to invagination pancreaticojejunostomy, but more research is needed to confirm this.\nIn summary, both duct-to-mucosa and invagination pancreaticojejunostomy are effective techniques for preventing postoperative pancreatic fistula after pancreatoduodenectomy, and the choice between them should be individualized based on the patient's specific needs and the surgeon's experience and preference.",

Studies have shown that it is effective in raising blood sugar levels and resolving hypoglycemic symptoms in newborns. However, it is important to note that dextrose gel should only be administered under the guidance of a healthcare professional, as excessive administration can lead to hyperglycemia, which can also be harmful.\nA study published in the Journal of Pediatrics found that dextrose gel was effective in resolving hypoglycemia in 85% of newborns within 30 minutes of administration. Additionally, a review of 14 studies on the use of dextrose gel for neonatal hypoglycemia published in the Journal of Perinatology found that it was effective in 71% of cases.\nHowever, it is important to note that dextrose gel is not without risks. It can cause gastrointestinal upset, and in rare cases, it can lead to a condition called hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, which can be dangerous.\nIn summary, oral dextrose gel is generally considered safe and effective in correcting hypoglycemia in newborn infants, but it should only be administered under the guidance of a healthcare professional and with proper monitoring of blood sugar levels to avoid any potential complications.",

            "gold_answer": "Compared with placebo/no treatment, moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that intermittent diazepam (oral or rectal) and continuous phenobarbital probably reduce seizure recurrence at 6 and 12 months in children with febrile seizures (at 12 months: intermittent diazepam 158 vs 230 per 1000 children; continuous phenobarbital 181 vs 333 per 1000 children). When intermittent doses of rectal and oral diazepam were analyzed separately, researchers observed similar benefits at 12 months; results for 6 months were inconsistent. Beyond 12 months, results were inconsistent and numbers of children smaller. Adverse events were inconsistently reported, and trials were small and were not combined in meta\u2010analyses. Results for other treatment regimens (intermittent phenobarbital, continuous oral valproate, continuous oral clobazam, continuous phenytoin, intermittent oral levetiracetam) or for comparisons with active treatments (continuous phenobarbital vs intermittent diazepam, intermittent rectal diazepam vs intermittent rectal valproate, intermittent oral diazepam vs oral clobazam) were informed by small RCTs, so no conclusions could be drawn.",

            "gold_answer": "Compared with placebo/no treatment, moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that intermittent diazepam (oral or rectal) and continuous phenobarbital probably reduce seizure recurrence at 6 and 12 months in children with febrile seizures (at 12 months: intermittent diazepam 158 vs 230 per 1000 children; continuous phenobarbital 181 vs 333 per 1000 children). When intermittent doses of rectal and oral diazepam were analyzed separately, researchers observed similar benefits at 12 months; results for 6 months were inconsistent. Beyond 12 months, results were inconsistent and numbers of children smaller. Adverse events were inconsistently reported, and trials were small and were not combined in meta\u2010analyses. Results for other treatment regimens (intermittent phenobarbital, continuous oral valproate, continuous oral clobazam, continuous phenytoin, intermittent oral levetiracetam) or for comparisons with active treatments (continuous phenobarbital vs intermittent diazepam, intermittent rectal diazepam vs intermittent rectal valproate, intermittent oral diazepam vs oral clobazam) were informed by small RCTs, so no conclusions could be drawn.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "INTERMITTENT (intermittent): occurring (regularly or irregularly) between two time points; repeatedly stopping, then starting again\nREGIMEN (regimen): pattern of giving treatment\nRCT (rct): A study which tests the effectiveness and safety of treatments or procedures as fairly and objectively as possible. By randomly assigning patients to different treatments for the same problem, the results can be assessed equally with the aim of discovering the best possible procedure for the condition.",

            "llm_answer": "Prophylactic use of benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and anticonvulsants for management of febrile seizures in children can have various effects, including:\n1. Reduced seizure frequency: These medications can help reduce the frequency of seizures in children who experience recurrent febrile seizures.\n2. Side effects: Each medication has its own set of potential side effects, such as drowsiness, dizziness, and gastrointestinal disturbances. Long-term use of these medications can also lead to physical dependence and withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuation.\n3. Impact on cognitive development: There is limited research on the long-term cognitive effects of these medications in children, and some studies suggest that they may have a negative impact on cognitive development and memory.\n4. Interaction with other medications: These medications can interact with other medications a child may be taking, which can affect their efficacy or increase the risk of adverse effects.\n5. Monitoring requirements: Children taking these medications may require regular monitoring of blood levels, liver function, and kidney function to ensure safe and effective use.\n6. Cost and accessibility: These medications can be expensive, and accessibility may be limited in some regions, which can impact their use and effectiveness.\n7. Alternative treatments: Other treatments, such as fever management and seizure prevention strategies, may be effective alternatives to prophylactic medications in some cases.\nIt is important to note that the decision to use prophylactic medications for febrile seizures in children should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the child's medical history, seizure frequency, and individual needs. A healthcare professional should be consulted to determine the best course of treatment.",

Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that can help maintain a healthy gut microbiome, which is important for the development and function of various bodily systems, including the immune system.\nStudies have found that probiotics can help reduce the risk of preterm birth, which is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Probiotics have also been shown to reduce the risk of other complications in preterm infants, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious condition that can cause damage to the intestines.\nIt's important to note that not all probiotics are the same, and some strains have been found to be more effective than others in preventing morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. For example, the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any supplements during pregnancy, including probiotics, to ensure safety and effectiveness. Additionally, it's important to note that while probiotics can help reduce the risk of complications, they are not a guarantee against them, and other factors such as proper prenatal care, a healthy diet, and a safe delivery are also important for a healthy pregnancy and baby.",
