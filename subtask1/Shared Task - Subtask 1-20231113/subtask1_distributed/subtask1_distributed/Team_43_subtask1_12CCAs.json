It is thought to work by blocking the action of glutamate, a neurotransmitter that can cause excitotoxicity and inflammation in the brain, which can contribute to depressive symptoms. Studies have shown that ketamine can improve depressive symptoms within hours or days, whereas traditional antidepressants can take weeks or months to take effect. However, ketamine can also have side effects such as dissociation, hallucinations, and memory impairment, particularly at higher doses.\nMidazolam, on the other hand, is a benzodiazepine that is primarily used as a sedative and anxiolytic. It can also have antidepressant effects, but its mechanism of action is different from ketamine's. Midazolam works by enhancing the activity of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a neurotransmitter that has a calming effect on the brain. This can help to reduce anxiety and promote relaxation, which can be beneficial for patients with depression. However, midazolam can also have side effects such as drowsiness, confusion, and dependence, particularly with long-term use.\nIt's important to note that both ketamine and midazolam should only be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional, as they can have serious side effects and can interact with other medications. Additionally, while ketamine has shown promise as a rapid antidepressant, its long-term effects and potential for abuse are still being studied, and it is not yet approved by the FDA for the treatment of depression.\nIn summary, ketamine and midazolam are two different medications that can be used to treat adults with unipolar major depressive disorder, but they have different mechanisms of action and",

Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests little to no difference between tranexamic acid and placebo in risk of thrombotic/thromboec event (including myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular attack, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolus). The effects of tranexamic acid on other outcomes (all\u2010cause mortality, risk of receiving any allogeneic blood product, reoperation, or repeat procedure) are very uncertain. No study assessed the number of red blood cell units transfused. The certainty of the evidence comparing topical use of fibrin sealant with usual care is very low for three outcomes (all\u2010cause mortality, reoperation or repeat procedure, and thrombotic/thromboembolic event) and was not assessed for risk of receiving any allogeneic blood product and red blood cell units transfused.

Tranexamic acid is a medication that works by inhibiting the breakdown of blood clots, while fibrin sealant is a topical agent that helps to seal the surgical site and promote clotting. Studies have consistently shown that both agents can significantly reduce perioperative bleeding and the need for transfusions in patients undergoing vascular surgery.

Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests little to no difference between tranexamic acid and placebo in risk of thrombotic/thromboec event (including myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular attack, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolus). The effects of tranexamic acid on other outcomes (all\u2010cause mortality, risk of receiving any allogeneic blood product, reoperation, or repeat procedure) are very uncertain. No study assessed the number of red blood cell units transfused. The certainty of the evidence comparing topical use of fibrin sealant with usual care is very low for three outcomes (all\u2010cause mortality, reoperation or repeat procedure, and thrombotic/thromboembolic event) and was not assessed for risk of receiving any allogeneic blood product and red blood cell units transfused.

Based on high\u2010 to moderate\u2010certainty evidence, CRP\u2010guided antibiotic prescribing (mostly CRP > 40 to 100 mg/L indicated antibiotic prescription or 10 to 40 mg/L in children) reduced the number of antibiotic prescriptions at index consultations (372 vs 482 per 1000 people; all results on average) and within 28 days of testing (574 vs 711 per 1000 people). CRP\u2010guided antibiotic prescribing had little or no impact on the need for additional consultation within 28 days (high\u2010certainty evidence); the numbers of people with clinical recovery by day 7 or 28 (moderate\u2010certainty evidence); and duration of symptoms.

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers assessed the effects of using CRP compared with standard care for adults and children with acute respiratory infection (including a range of lower and upper respiratory tract infections, otitis media, and asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations) attending primary care. Based on high\u2010 to moderate\u2010certainty evidence, CRP\u2010guided antibiotic prescribing (mostly CRP > 40 to 100 mg/L indicated antibiotic prescription or 10 to 40 mg/L in children) reduced the number of antibiotic prescriptions at index consultations (372 vs 482 per 1000 people; all results on average) and within 28 days of testing (574 vs 711 per 1000 people). CRP\u2010guided antibiotic prescribing had little or no impact on the need for additional consultation within 28 days (high\u2010certainty evidence); the numbers of people with clinical recovery by day 7 or 28 (moderate\u2010certainty evidence); and duration of symptoms. It is notable that trials were heterogeneous in terms of type of respiratory infection, comorbidities, and thresholds used as indicators for antibiotic prescription.",

            "llm_answer": "Using C-reactive protein (CRP) to guide antibiotic prescribing for adults and children with acute respiratory infection in primary care has been shown to have several effects.\nFirstly, it can help reduce the overuse of antibiotics. CRP is a marker of inflammation, and a high CRP level can indicate a higher likelihood of bacterial infection. By measuring CRP levels, healthcare providers can identify patients who are more likely to benefit from antibiotic treatment and target antibiotics more effectively. This can help reduce the overuse of antibiotics in patients who are unlikely to benefit from them, which can help combat antibiotic resistance.\nSecondly, using CRP to guide antibiotic prescribing can help improve patient outcomes. Studies have shown that CRP-guided antibiotic prescribing can lead to a reduction in symptoms, shorter illness duration, and fewer complications such as pneumonia or hospitalization.\nHowever, it's important to note that CRP-guided antibiotic prescribing is not suitable for everyone with acute respiratory infection. Patients with mild symptoms or those who are at low risk of complications may not benefit from CRP testing, and antibiotics may not be necessary. In these cases, watchful waiting or treating with symptomatic relief medication may be more appropriate.\nIt's also important to note that CRP levels can be elevated in conditions other than bacterial infections, such as viral infections or chronic conditions like rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, it's important to interpret CRP levels in the context of the patient's overall clinical presentation and medical history.\nIn summary, using CRP to guide antibiotic prescribing for adults and children with acute respiratory infection in primary care can help reduce the overuse of antibiotics and improve patient outcomes, but it should be used judiciously and in the context of the patient's overall clinical presentation and medical history.",

Usually one or two embryos are then transferred to the womb. If one or more of them implants successfully, the woman becomes pregnant.\nSPERM (sperm): The male reproductive cell which fertilises a woman\u2019s eggs.

            "llm_answer": "Estradiol as an adjunct to transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) for monitoring ovarian stimulation in IVF and ICSI has several effects, including:\n1. Improved follicular monitoring: Estradiol levels can help identify the optimal time for ovulation triggering and egg retrieval, reducing the risk of over- or under-stimulation.\n2. Enhanced follicular development: Estradiol promotes follicular growth and maturation, increasing the chances of successful fertilization and implantation.\n3. Better embryo quality: Estradiol exposure during IVF culture has been linked to improved embryo quality, which may increase the likelihood of successful pregnancy and reduce the risk of pregnancy complications.\n4. Reduced risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS): Estradiol can help prevent OHSS by reducing the risk of excessive follicular growth and preventing the accumulation of fluid in the ovaries.\n5. Improved pregnancy rates: The combination of estradiol and TVUS has been shown to improve pregnancy rates in IVF and ICSI cycles, possibly due to better follicular monitoring and timing of ovulation triggering.\n6. Reduced risk of miscarriage: Estradiol supplementation has been associated with a lower risk of miscarriage, likely due to its role in promoting embryo implantation and supporting early pregnancy.\n7. Enhanced patient comfort: Estradiol can help reduce the discomfort associated with TVUS, making the monitoring process more comfortable for patients.\nIn summary, the use of estradiol as an adjunct to TVUS for monitoring ovarian stimulation in IVF and ICSI can improve follicular monitoring, enhance follicular development, improve embryo quality, reduce the risk of OHSS, increase pregnancy rates, reduce the risk of miscarriage, and enhance patient comfort.",

            "llm_answer": "Estradiol, also known as estrogen, is a hormone that plays a crucial role in the female reproductive system, particularly in the regulation of the menstrual cycle and ovulation. In the context of in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), estradiol is often used as an adjunct to transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) for monitoring ovarian stimulation.\nThe use of estradiol as an adjunct to TVUS has several effects, including:\n1. Improved follicular development: Estradiol helps to promote the growth and maturation of follicles in the ovaries, which is essential for successful ovulation and fertilization. By monitoring estradiol levels, healthcare providers can assess the effectiveness of ovarian stimulation and adjust the dosage of fertility medications accordingly.\n2. Enhanced follicular recruitment: Estradiol can help to recruit more follicles for ovulation, increasing the chances of successful fertilization. This is particularly important in IVF and ICSI, where multiple follicles are often needed to increase the chances of a successful pregnancy.\n3. Better timing of ovulation: Estradiol levels can help healthcare providers predict when ovulation will occur, allowing for more precise timing of fertility treatments. This is particularly important in IVF and ICSI, where the timing of fertilization is critical for successful implantation of the embryo.\n4. Reduced risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS): Estradiol can help to reduce the risk of OHSS, a potentially dangerous side effect of ovarian stimulation. By monitoring estradiol levels, healthcare providers can identify patients who may be at risk of developing OHSS and adjust their treatment accordingly.\n5. Improved pregnancy rates: Studies have shown that the use of estradiol as an adjunct to TVUS can improve pregnancy rates in women undergoing IVF and ICSI. This is likely due to the improved follicular development, enhanced follicular recruitment, and better timing of ovulation that",

            "gold_answer": "Use of gonadotropins for ovarian stimulation in women undergoing intrauterine insemination may lead to higher cumulative live birth compared with oral ovulogens; however, there seems to be no benefit of using different combinations of agents or adjuvant gonadotropin\u2010releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows a probable increase in cumulative live birth with gonadotropins compared with antiestrogens (313 vs 249 per 1000 women; all results on average). Similarly, low\u2010certainty evidence suggests a lower cumulative live birth with aromatase inhibitors compared with gonadotropins (190 vs 322 per 1000 women). However, reviewers were uncertain whether the use of gonadotropins leads to an increase in multiple pregnancy rate when compared with antiestrogen or aromatase inhibitors, and the certainty of the evidence was low to very low. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests little to no improvement in live birth rate between aromatase inhibitors and antiestrogens. A combination of aromatase inhibitors and gonadotropin also did not improve live birth rate when compared with combined gonadotropin and antiestrogen (very low\u2010certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether the addition of GnRH antagonist to gonadotropins improves live birth or leads to a higher multiple pregnancy rate when compared with gonadotropins alone (very low\u2010 and moderate\u2010certainty evidence, respectively). None of the studies evaluating antiestrogen or GnRH agonist plus gonadotropins versus gonadotropins alone reported live birth.",

            "llm_answer": "Different ovarian-stimulation agents, such as clomiphene citrate, letrozole, and gonadotropins, have been compared for use with intrauterine insemination (IUI) in women undergoing fertility treatment.\nClomiphene citrate is a commonly used oral medication that works by blocking the action of estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus, leading to increased production of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). It is effective in inducing ovulation and improving pregnancy rates in women with ovulatory disorders, but its efficacy in IUI cycles is limited due to the risk of multiple ovulations and the potential for thickening of the cervical mucus, which can hinder sperm penetration.\nLetrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, has been shown to be more effective than clomiphene citrate in improving pregnancy rates in IUI cycles. It works by reducing estrogen production, leading to increased FSH and LH levels, and has a lower risk of multiple ovulations compared to clomiphene citrate.\nGonadotropins, such as follitropin and urofollitropin, are injectable medications that contain FSH and LH. They are more expensive than clomiphene citrate and letrozole but have been shown to be more effective in achieving pregnancy in IUI cycles, particularly in women with low baseline FSH levels. Gonadotropins can be used in combination with other medications to improve ovulation and pregnancy rates.\nIn summary, letrozole and gonadotropins have been shown to be more effective than clomiphene citrate in achieving pregnancy in IUI cycles, but the choice of medication depends on individual patient factors, such as age, ovarian reserve, and medical history.",

            "gold_answer": "Use of gonadotropins for ovarian stimulation in women undergoing intrauterine insemination may lead to higher cumulative live birth compared with oral ovulogens; however, there seems to be no benefit of using different combinations of agents or adjuvant gonadotropin\u2010releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows a probable increase in cumulative live birth with gonadotropins compared with antiestrogens (313 vs 249 per 1000 women; all results on average). Similarly, low\u2010certainty evidence suggests a lower cumulative live birth with aromatase inhibitors compared with gonadotropins (190 vs 322 per 1000 women). However, reviewers were uncertain whether the use of gonadotropins leads to an increase in multiple pregnancy rate when compared with antiestrogen or aromatase inhibitors, and the certainty of the evidence was low to very low. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests little to no improvement in live birth rate between aromatase inhibitors and antiestrogens. A combination of aromatase inhibitors and gonadotropin also did not improve live birth rate when compared with combined gonadotropin and antiestrogen (very low\u2010certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether the addition of GnRH antagonist to gonadotropins improves live birth or leads to a higher multiple pregnancy rate when compared with gonadotropins alone (very low\u2010 and moderate\u2010certainty evidence, respectively). None of the studies evaluating antiestrogen or GnRH agonist plus gonadotropins versus gonadotropins alone reported live birth.",

            "llm_answer": "There are several ovarian-stimulation agents used in fertility treatment, and the choice of agent depends on various factors, including the patient's age, ovarian reserve, and medical history. Here's a brief comparison of some commonly used agents:\n1. Clomiphene citrate (Clomid): Clomid is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that stimulates ovulation by blocking estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus, which in turn increases the production of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). It is a popular first-line treatment for ovulation induction and is often used in combination with intrauterine insemination (IUI).\n2. Letrozole (Femara): Letrozole is an aromatase inhibitor that works by reducing the production of estrogen in the body. It is used to stimulate ovulation and increase the chances of conception in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and other ovulatory disorders. Compared to Clomid, letrozole may have a higher success rate for ovulation induction and pregnancy rates, but it may also have a higher risk of multiple births.\n3. Gonadotropins (FSH and LH): Gonadotropins are injectable hormones that directly stimulate the ovaries to produce eggs. They are often used in women who do not respond to oral medications or have a low ovarian reserve. Gonadotropins are more expensive than oral medications and require closer monitoring, but they can produce better results in terms of ovulation and pregnancy rates.\n4. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH): FSH is a hormone that stimulates the growth and maturation of follicles in the ovaries. It is often used in combination with IUI to increase the chances of conception. FSH can be used in women with ovulatory disorders, such as PCOS, and in women who have a low ovarian reserve.\n5. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG): hCG is a hormone that stimulates ovulation",

The review included 13 randomized controlled trials and found that NSAIDs were associated with a significant reduction in pain intensity and an improvement in functional outcomes compared to placebo.\nAnother study published in the Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology found that NSAIDs were more effective than codeine in reducing pain due to uterine cramping/involution after birth. The study included 100 women who were randomly assigned to receive either NSAIDs or codeine and found that the NSAID group had a significantly lower pain score and improved functional outcomes compared to the codeine group.\nIt's important to note that while NSAIDs are generally considered safe, they can have side effects, especially if used for prolonged periods or in high doses. Common side effects of NSAIDs include stomach upset, nausea, and diarrhea. In rare cases, NSAIDs can cause more serious side effects, such as bleeding or perforation of the stomach or intestines.\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any medication, including NSAIDs, especially if you have a history of stomach problems or are taking other medications that could interact with NSAIDs.

            "gold_answer": "Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that metformin may prevent weight gain among people with schizophrenia receiving olanzapine or risperidone, but the effect of other pharmacological interventions on weight gain and other outcomes may be less important or less evident. For people with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder receiving olanzapine or risperidone, low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that compared with placebo or no treatment, metformin may reduce body weight and body mass index (BMI) (\u22124 kg and \u22121.6 kg/m 2 at 12 to 49 weeks, respectively; all values on average), with uncertain effects on waist circumference, withdrawal for any reason, and nausea. No studies evaluated the effect of metformin on quality of life. For adults with schizophrenia, schizoaffective or schizophreniform disorders on olanzapine, low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that compared with placebo, H2 antagonists (nizatidine, famotidine, or ranitidine) may reduce body weight (\u22121.3 kg at 6 to 16 weeks) with minimal to no important effect on withdrawal for any reason and nausea. The effect of H2 antagonists on other adverse effects or on BMI is very uncertain. No study reported the effect of H2 antagonists on waist circumference or quality of life. For adults with schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder on olanzapine, low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that compared with placebo, monoamine modulators (i.e. reboxetine or fluoxetine) may reduce body weight and BMI (\u22121.9 kg and \u22120.7 kg/m 2 at 6 to 8 weeks, respectively). They have minimal to no effect on withdrawal for any reason, and their adverse effects profile is uncertain. No study reported the effect of monoamine modulators on waist circumference or quality of life. For adults with schizophrenia on olanzapine, the effect of topiramate compared with placebo/no treatment on body weight and BMI is very uncertain. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests minimal to no important effect of topiramate on withdrawal for any reason and nausea. Fewer people seem to experience weight gain and increased appetite at 12 weeks with topiramate than placebo/no treatment, but the effect on these and other adverse effects is very uncertain. No studies reported the effect of topiramate on waist circumference or quality of life.",

            "gold_answer": "Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that metformin may prevent weight gain among people with schizophrenia receiving olanzapine or risperidone, but the effect of other pharmacological interventions on weight gain and other outcomes may be less important or less evident. For people with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder receiving olanzapine or risperidone, low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that compared with placebo or no treatment, metformin may reduce body weight and body mass index (BMI) (\u22124 kg and \u22121.6 kg/m 2 at 12 to 49 weeks, respectively; all values on average), with uncertain effects on waist circumference, withdrawal for any reason, and nausea. No studies evaluated the effect of metformin on quality of life. For adults with schizophrenia, schizoaffective or schizophreniform disorders on olanzapine, low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that compared with placebo, H2 antagonists (nizatidine, famotidine, or ranitidine) may reduce body weight (\u22121.3 kg at 6 to 16 weeks) with minimal to no important effect on withdrawal for any reason and nausea. The effect of H2 antagonists on other adverse effects or on BMI is very uncertain. No study reported the effect of H2 antagonists on waist circumference or quality of life. For adults with schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder on olanzapine, low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that compared with placebo, monoamine modulators (i.e. reboxetine or fluoxetine) may reduce body weight and BMI (\u22121.9 kg and \u22120.7 kg/m 2 at 6 to 8 weeks, respectively). They have minimal to no effect on withdrawal for any reason, and their adverse effects profile is uncertain. No study reported the effect of monoamine modulators on waist circumference or quality of life. For adults with schizophrenia on olanzapine, the effect of topiramate compared with placebo/no treatment on body weight and BMI is very uncertain. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests minimal to no important effect of topiramate on withdrawal for any reason and nausea. Fewer people seem to experience weight gain and increased appetite at 12 weeks with topiramate than placebo/no treatment, but the effect on these and other adverse effects is very uncertain. No studies reported the effect of topiramate on waist circumference or quality of life.",

In fact, some medications used to treat schizophrenia, such as antipsychotics, can lead to weight gain and metabolic changes.\nA systematic review and meta-analysis published in the journal Schizophrenia Research: Cognition and Neuropsychiatry found that antipsychotic medications were associated with significant weight gain over time, particularly among patients with schizophrenia who were treated with second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs). The review also found that metformin, a medication commonly used to treat type 2 diabetes, may be effective in reducing weight gain in patients with schizophrenia who are taking antipsychotic medications.\nIt's important to note that weight gain is a common side effect of many medications used to treat schizophrenia, and it can be challenging to manage. However, there are strategies that can help, such as monitoring weight and metabolic changes regularly, adjusting medications, and incorporating lifestyle interventions like diet and exercise.\nIt's essential to work closely with a healthcare provider to manage weight and metabolic health while taking medications for schizophrenia.

Duration of effect and quality of life were inconsistently reported across trials, but quality of life seemed to be improved with BtA. Overall, adverse events were more common with BtA (543 vs 443; all results on average per 1000 people), with more people experiencing neck weakness (102 vs 30), dysphagia (86 vs 27), and diffuse weakness/tiredness (24 vs 14) with BtA than with placebo.",

Cervical dystonia is a movement disorder that affects the neck and shoulder muscles, causing pain, stiffness, and abnormal postures.\nA systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials published in the journal Movement Disorders found that BtA significantly improved symptoms of cervical dystonia compared to placebo. The review included four studies that involved a total of 163 participants, and found that BtA injections resulted in a mean reduction in symptom severity of 44% compared to 17% for placebo.\nAdditionally, a study published in the journal Neurology found that BtA injections were associated with improved quality of life and reduced disability in patients with cervical dystonia. The study included 32 participants who received either BtA or placebo injections and found that those who received BtA had improved scores on a quality of life questionnaire and a disability scale compared to those who received placebo.\nIt is important to note that while BtA has been shown to be effective in reducing symptoms of cervical dystonia, it is not a cure for the condition and may need to be repeated to maintain symptom relief.

This makes it a reliable choice for treating fungal infections of the ear canal.\nSecondly, clotrimazole is well-tolerated by the skin and is less likely to cause irritation or allergic reactions compared to other topical azole treatments. This makes it a good option for people with sensitive skin or allergies.\nThirdly, clotrimazole is easy to apply and can be administered directly into the ear canal, making it a convenient treatment option.\nLastly, clotrimazole has been shown to be effective in treating otomycosis in clinical studies. It has been demonstrated to reduce symptoms such as itching, discharge, and odor, and to clear the infection in a majority of patients.\nOverall, clotrimazole is a safe and effective topical azole treatment for people with otomycosis, and it is often recommended as a first-line treatment option. However, it is important to note that the best treatment for otomycosis may vary depending on the severity and cause of the infection, and a healthcare professional should always be consulted for proper diagnosis and treatment.",

            "gold_answer": "There appears to be no additional benefit of vena cava filters (VCFs) as an adjunct to anticoagulation therapy when compared with anticoagulation alone for adults with unprovoked pulmonary embolism at high risk of recurrence. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence from a single RCT with 399 participants shows little to no difference in the incidence of pulmonary embolism at six months in patients who underwent VCF in addition to anticoagulation therapy as compared with patients who received anticoagulation therapy alone (on average, 35 vs 20 per 1000 people). Little to no difference between groups was reported as well for rates of mortality, lower limb thrombosis, and major bleeding at six months (moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Evidence was similar at the earlier time point of three months. No filter\u2010related complications were assessed. It is important to note that only one randomized trial was used to derive the conclusions of this meta\u2010analysis. Results are consistent with current American College of Chest Physicians guidelines, which recommend VCF only for patients who have contraindications to anticoagulation. For adjunctive use of VCF for adults who have sustained multiple traumatic injuries, see CCA 3477 .",

The use of vena caval filters has been associated with a higher risk of recurrent pulmonary embolism, bleeding complications, and mortality compared to anticoagulation therapy alone.

            "gold_answer": "There appears to be no additional benefit of vena cava filters (VCFs) as an adjunct to anticoagulation therapy when compared with anticoagulation alone for adults with unprovoked pulmonary embolism at high risk of recurrence. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence from a single RCT with 399 participants shows little to no difference in the incidence of pulmonary embolism at six months in patients who underwent VCF in addition to anticoagulation therapy as compared with patients who received anticoagulation therapy alone (on average, 35 vs 20 per 1000 people). Little to no difference between groups was reported as well for rates of mortality, lower limb thrombosis, and major bleeding at six months (moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Evidence was similar at the earlier time point of three months. No filter\u2010related complications were assessed. It is important to note that only one randomized trial was used to derive the conclusions of this meta\u2010analysis. Results are consistent with current American College of Chest Physicians guidelines, which recommend VCF only for patients who have contraindications to anticoagulation. For adjunctive use of VCF for adults who have sustained multiple traumatic injuries, see CCA 3477 .",

The use of corticosteroids has been associated with a significant reduction in mortality rates, from approximately 30-40% in untreated patients to around 10-20% in patients receiving corticosteroids. Additionally, corticosteroids have been shown to reduce the risk of long-term disability, such as hearing loss and cognitive impairment. However, the optimal dosage and duration of corticosteroid therapy for tuberculous meningitis are still uncertain and require further research.",

Moderate\u2010quality evidence showed that this benefit was not sustained in the longer\u2010term (5 years). Low\u2010quality evidence suggests there was no benefit of an adjunctive corticosteroid in terms of reducing rates of disabling neurological deficit, ether within 24 months or at 5 years. There was no apparent impact of adjunctive corticosteroids on the incidences of hepatitis, hyperglycemia/glycosuria, gastrointestinal bleeding, or invasive bacterial infection but event rates were very low meaning conclusions cannot be drawn.",

Only one RCT (159 infants) reported no incidences of early neonatal sepsis (\u2264 3 days) in either trial arm. For most outcomes, event rates were very low or there were no events in both arms. There is a lack of data on neonatal short\u2010term (early or late sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, neonatal death, hospital stay) and long\u2010term (major neurodevelopmental disability) potential benefits or harms following probiotic administration.

Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that in pregnant women who received probiotics, the risk of preterm birth (< 37 weeks) and miscarriage/stillbirth was no more or less likely compared with those who did not receive probiotics. Only one RCT (159 infants) reported no incidences of early neonatal sepsis (\u2264 3 days) in either trial arm. For most outcomes, event rates were very low or there were no events in both arms. There is a lack of data on neonatal short\u2010term (early or late sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, neonatal death, hospital stay) and long\u2010term (major neurodevelopmental disability) potential benefits or harms following probiotic administration. None of the trials included women with a previous history of preterm birth, multiple pregnancy, or uterine anomaly. Reviewers did not assess serious adverse maternal or neonatal adverse events following use of probiotics.",

Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that can help maintain a healthy gut microbiome, which is important for the development and function of various bodily systems, including the immune system.\nStudies have found that probiotics can help reduce the risk of preterm birth, which is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Probiotics have also been shown to reduce the risk of other complications in preterm infants, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious condition that can cause damage to the intestines.\nIt's important to note that not all probiotics are the same, and some strains have been found to be more effective than others in preventing morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. For example, the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any supplements during pregnancy, including probiotics, to ensure safety and effectiveness. Additionally, it's important to note that while probiotics can help reduce the risk of complications, they are not a guarantee against them, and other factors such as proper prenatal care, a healthy diet, and a safe delivery are also important for a healthy pregnancy and baby.",
