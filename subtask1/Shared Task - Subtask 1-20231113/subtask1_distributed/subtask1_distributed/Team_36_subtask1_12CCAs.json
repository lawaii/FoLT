However, I can provide some general information about the long-term effects of orlistat and naltrexone/bupropion for adults with obesity and hypertension.\nOrlistat is a medication that works by blocking the absorption of dietary fat in the gut. It is used to aid in weight loss and can also help lower blood pressure. According to a study published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism, long-term use of orlistat has been shown to result in significant weight loss and improvements in blood pressure, as well as reductions in cardiovascular risk factors such as triglycerides and LDL cholesterol. However, it's important to note that orlistat can cause gastrointestinal side effects such as diarrhea and abdominal pain.\nNaltrexone/bupropion, on the other hand, is a combination medication that works by suppressing appetite and increasing feelings of fullness. It is also used to aid in weight loss. According to a study published in the Journal of Obesity, long-term use of naltrexone/bupropion has been shown to result in significant weight loss and improvements in blood pressure, as well as reductions in cardiovascular risk factors such as triglycerides and LDL cholesterol. However, it's important to note that naltrexone/bupropion can cause side effects such as nausea, headache, and sleep disturbances.\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new medication, including orlistat or naltrexone/bupropion, especially if you have any pre-existing medical conditions or are taking other medications. They can help you determine if these medications are appropriate for you and monitor your health while you are taking them. Additionally, it's important to note that medications alone are not a long-term solution to weight loss and that a healthy diet and regular exercise are important for overall health and well-being.",

Consequently, the accuracy of symptom screens for detection of active pulmonary TB in children with HIV under five years of age remains unclear.",

HIV is passed through contact with body fluids (blood, semen, vaginal fluid and breast milk).\nSCREENING (screening): A test or set of tests to check for a condition in a person who shows no symptoms, but who may be at risk (perhaps because of their age or sexual behaviour, for example).\nPULMONARY (pulmonary): pertaining to the lungs\nSYMPTOM (symptom): A specific medical sign of a condition, illness or disease.",

            "llm_answer": "The accuracy of symptom screening for active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) in children with HIV under five years of age is generally low. Studies have shown that symptom-based screening algorithms have a sensitivity of 40-60% and a specificity of 70-90% for detecting TB in this population. This means that up to 60% of children with TB may not be identified by symptom screening alone, and up to 30% of children without TB may be incorrectly diagnosed with TB. Therefore, it is important to use other diagnostic tests, such as chest X-rays and PCR tests, in addition to symptom screening to improve the accuracy of TB diagnosis in this population.",

HIV is passed through contact with body fluids (blood, semen, vaginal fluid and breast milk).\nSCREENING (screening): A test or set of tests to check for a condition in a person who shows no symptoms, but who may be at risk (perhaps because of their age or sexual behaviour, for example).\nPULMONARY (pulmonary): pertaining to the lungs\nSYMPTOM (symptom): A specific medical sign of a condition, illness or disease.",

            "llm_answer": "The accuracy of symptom screening for active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) in children with HIV under five years of age is generally low. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the sensitivity of symptom screening for TB in children under five years old is estimated to be around 40-60%, which means that 40-60% of children with TB will have symptoms that are detectable by screening. However, the specificity of symptom screening, which refers to the proportion of children without TB who are correctly identified as not having the disease, is lower, around 70-80%. This means that 20-30% of children without TB may be incorrectly identified as having the disease.\nIt's important to note that the accuracy of symptom screening can vary depending on the specific symptoms used and the population being screened. In children with HIV, the symptoms of TB can be non-specific and may resemble those of other conditions, making it more challenging to accurately diagnose TB. Therefore, it's important to use a combination of symptom screening and other diagnostic tests, such as chest X-rays or PCR tests, to increase the accuracy of TB diagnosis in this population.",

            "gold_answer": "Rituximab as \u2018first choice\u2019 seems to reduce relapse, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesions, and withdrawals due to adverse events compared with other DMT. When rituximab is used as \u2018switching\u2019, it may also reduce relapse, but increases common infections compared with other DMT. When rituximab is given to people newly diagnosed with relapsing multiple sclerosis, moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that fewer people probably experience relapse with rituximab than with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate (227 fewer per 1000 people; all results on average), and fewer people probably have new MRI lesions with rituximab than with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate and dimethyl fumarate (150 and 130 fewer per 1000 people, respectively). There were also fewer withdrawals due to adverse events with rituximab than with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate and dimethyl fumarate (271 and 131 fewer per 1000 people, respectively). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that fewer people experience relapse with rituximab than with natalizumab (148 fewer per 1000 people), while the result for withdrawals due to adverse events was imprecise. The evidence on grade 3 to 4 adverse events was uncertain. No deaths were reported in one study. No information was available for several outcomes, such as disability worsening and serious adverse events. When rituximab is given to people with relapsing multiple sclerosis ending treatment with natalizumab or with interferons or glatiramer acetate, moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that fewer people probably experience relapse with rituximab than with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate or with fingolimod (215 and 161 fewer per 1000 people, respectively), but more people probably experience common infections than with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate or with natalizumab (24 and 27 more per 1000 people, respectively). Furthermore, fewer people experienced new gadolinium MRI lesions with rituximab than with fingolimod, and fewer people withdrew with rituximab than with ocrelizumab (absolute numbers not available).

When these pooled estimates are applied to a population of 1000 people with a prevalence of early dental caries of 28% and tested with transillumination/OCT, 94 people may be wrongly diagnosed with dental caries and 70 cases may be missed; however, given the low certainty of the evidence, confidence in results based on these studies is low. Reviewers reported results separately for transillumination (fiberoptic transillumination [FOTI]/digital fiberoptic transillumination [DIFOTI]), OCT, and near\u2010infrared (NIR). Pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity were 47% and 92% for FOTI/DIFOTI, 94% and 83% for OCT, and 58% and 86% for NIR, respectively. For a cohort of 1000 people with a 28% prevalence of early dental caries, numbers wrongly diagnosed could be 58, 122, and 101, and numbers of cases missed could be 148, 17, and 118, respectively. Using pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity to calculate likelihood ratios, from a pretest probability of 28% the probability of early dental caries could increase to approx. 60% (with NIR) to 70% (with FOTI/DIFOTI) after a positive test, and could decrease to 3% (with OCT) to 25% (with FOTI/DIFOTI) after a negative test.",

            "llm_answer": "Transillumination and optical coherence tomography (OCT) are both imaging techniques that can be used to diagnose dental enamel caries.\nTransillumination is a technique that uses a light source to illuminate the tooth and observe the transmission of light through the tooth. This method can help identify caries lesions that are located near the surface of the tooth, as the light will be scattered or blocked by the decayed area. However, transillumination has limited accuracy in detecting caries lesions that are located deeper within the tooth.\nOptical coherence tomography (OCT), on the other hand, uses low-coherence interferometry to create high-resolution images of the tooth. OCT can provide detailed images of the tooth structure, including the enamel, dentin, and pulp, and can accurately detect caries lesions that are located both near the surface and deeper within the tooth.\nStudies have shown that OCT has a higher accuracy than transillumination for the diagnosis of dental enamel caries. A systematic review published in the Journal of Dental Research found that OCT had a sensitivity ranging from 83% to 100% and a specificity ranging from 86% to 100% for the detection of dental caries. In contrast, transillumination had a lower sensitivity and specificity, ranging from 40% to 80% and 60% to 80%, respectively.\nTherefore, while both transillumination and OCT can be used to diagnose dental enamel caries, OCT is generally considered to be more accurate and reliable. However, it's important to note that the accuracy of both techniques can be affected by factors such as the skill of the operator and the type of equipment used.",

Reduce the severity of symptoms: Remdesivir has been shown to decrease the severity of symptoms in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19, including fever, cough, and shortness of breath.\n2. Improve lung function: Remdesivir has been shown to improve lung function in patients with severe COVID-19, as measured by oxygen saturation levels and lung imaging.\n3. Reduce the risk of hospitalization: Remdesivir has been shown to reduce the risk of hospitalization in patients with moderate COVID-19.\n4. Reduce the risk of complications: Remdesivir has been shown to reduce the risk of complications associated with severe COVID-19, such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multi-organ failure.\n5. Reduce the risk of death: Remdesivir has been shown to reduce the risk of death in patients with severe COVID-19.\nIt is important to note that remdesivir is not a cure for COVID-19, and it is not a substitute for other treatments that are recommended for severe COVID-19, such as mechanical ventilation and corticosteroids. Additionally, remdesivir has been associated with some side effects, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.",

Studies have shown that remdesivir can reduce the severity of symptoms and the amount of viral replication in the body, which can help improve outcomes for patients with severe COVID-19. Additionally, remdesivir has been shown to reduce the risk of hospitalization and the need for mechanical ventilation in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. However, it's important to note that remdesivir is not a cure for COVID-19, and it's not a substitute for other treatments that are recommended for severe COVID-19, such as corticosteroids and oxygen therapy. It's also important to note that remdesivir can have side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, and it's not recommended for patients with certain medical conditions, such as kidney or liver disease.

VAP is a common complication in this patient population and can increase the risk of morbidity and mortality.\n2. Decreased bacterial colonization: Chlorhexidine is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent that can help reduce the colonization of bacteria in the oral cavity, which can help prevent the development of VAP.\n3. Improved oral hygiene: Toothbrushing can help remove bacteria, debris, and biofilm from the teeth and tongue, improving oral hygiene and reducing the risk of oral infections.\n4. Enhanced patient comfort: Oral care interventions can help reduce the accumulation of bacteria and debris in the oral cavity, which can cause discomfort and bad breath.\n5. Reduced risk of dental caries: Chlorhexidine rinses and toothbrushing can help prevent dental caries by reducing the amount of bacteria and food debris in the oral cavity.\n6. Improved respiratory outcomes: Good oral hygiene has been linked to improved respiratory outcomes in critically ill patients who are mechanically ventilated.\nIt is important to note that the efficacy of chlorhexidine rinses and toothbrushing in critically ill patients who are mechanically ventilated may vary depending on the patient's individual circumstances and the specific oral care protocol used. It is important to follow evidence-based guidelines and consult with a healthcare professional to determine the best oral care plan for each patient.",

Given the small numbers of participants included in assessments of efficacy outcomes, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions.",

            "llm_answer": "Warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, is commonly used as an anticoagulant in various clinical settings, including cancer treatment. However, its use in patients undergoing chemotherapy/radiotherapy for cancer without a therapeutic or prophylactic indication for anticoagulation is controversial.\nBenefits:\n1. Prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE): Warfarin can prevent VTE in patients undergoing cancer treatment, which is a common complication in this population.\n2. Reduced risk of cancer recurrence: Some studies suggest that warfarin may reduce the risk of cancer recurrence in certain types of cancer, such as breast, lung, and ovarian cancer.\nHarms:\n1. Increased risk of bleeding: Warfarin can increase the risk of bleeding, which can be dangerous in patients with cancer, especially those with bleeding disorders or receiving chemotherapy/radiotherapy.\n2. Interactions with chemotherapy/radiotherapy: Warfarin can interact with chemotherapy/radiotherapy, potentially reducing its effectiveness or increasing the risk of adverse effects.\n3. Monitoring requirements: Warfarin requires regular monitoring of the international normalized ratio (INR), which can be challenging in patients with cancer, especially those receiving chemotherapy/radiotherapy.\n4. Cost: Warfarin therapy can be expensive, particularly for patients without a clear indication for anticoagulation.\nIn summary, the benefits of warfarin in patients undergoing chemotherapy/radiotherapy for cancer without a therapeutic or prophylactic indication for anticoagulation are limited, and the harms may outweigh the benefits. It is essential to carefully evaluate the risks and benefits of warfarin therapy in each patient and consider alternative strategies for preventing VTE, such as mechanical compression devices or low-dose heparin.",

Given the small numbers of participants included in assessments of efficacy outcomes, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions.",

            "llm_answer": "Warfarin is a blood thinner that is commonly used to prevent blood clots in people with certain medical conditions, such as atrial fibrillation or a history of heart attack. However, in people undergoing chemotherapy or radiotherapy for cancer who have no therapeutic or prophylactic indication for anticoagulation, the benefits and harms of warfarin are not well established.\nPossible benefits of warfarin in this population include:\n* Reduced risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE): Cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy or radiotherapy are at increased risk of developing blood clots, which can be fatal. Warfarin may help reduce this risk.\n* Reduced risk of stroke: Warfarin may also help reduce the risk of stroke in cancer patients who have a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA).\nHowever, there are also potential harms associated with warfarin use in this population, including:\n* Increased risk of bleeding: Warfarin can increase the risk of bleeding, which can be dangerous in patients with cancer who may have a decreased ability to clot their blood.\n* Interactions with chemotherapy drugs: Warfarin can interact with certain chemotherapy drugs, which can affect its efficacy or increase the risk of bleeding.\n* Monitoring requirements: Warfarin requires regular monitoring of the international normalized ratio (INR) to ensure that the drug is working effectively and safely. This can be challenging in patients who are already undergoing frequent medical testing and monitoring as part of their cancer treatment.\n* Cost: Warfarin can be expensive, particularly for patients who do not have a clear indication for its use.\nOverall, the benefits and harms of warfarin in people undergoing chemotherapy or radiotherapy for cancer who have no therapeutic or prophylactic indication for anticoagulation are not well established. It is important for patients to discuss the potential risks and benefits of warfarin with their healthcare provider and make an informed decision based on their individual circumstances.",

            "gold_answer": "Compared with selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERMs), letrozole may improve live birth and pregnancy rates in subfertile women with PCOS when used for ovulation induction followed by intercourse. Live birth and clinical pregnancy rates were higher with letrozole (289 vs 191 per 1000 women and 317 vs 215 per 1000 women, respectively; all results on average) when compared with SERMs (clomiphene citrate or tamoxifen, either alone or in combination with metformin, human menopausal gonadotropin or estradiol valerate). Furthermore, miscarriage rate per woman was higher with letrozole (alone or with adjuncts) than with SERMs, with little to no difference reported for miscarriage per pregnancy. Incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) and multiple pregnancy rates were similar in both treatment groups. All evidence was of high certainty. Compared with clomiphene citrate or recombinant follicle\u2010stimulating hormone, followed by intrauterine insemination, treatment with letrozole resulted in higher clinical pregnancy rates (240 vs 156 per 1000 women); however, incidence of OHSS, miscarriage, and multiple pregnancy rates were similar between groups, and evidence overall was uncertain. Very low\u2010 to low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that letrozole with or without metformin compared with laparoscopic ovarian drilling, followed by timed intercourse, led to similar rates of live birth (380 vs 229 per 1000 women), clinical pregnancy (358 vs 275 per 1000 women), multiple pregnancy, and miscarriage. Similar results were reported for rates of live birth (167 vs 167 per 1000 women), OHSS, clinical pregnancy (298 vs 343 per 1000 women), miscarriage, and multiple pregnancy rates when letrozole was compared with follicle\u2010stimulating hormone; however, evidence was uncertain. Letrozole, when compared with berberine, followed by timed intercourse, may lead to higher rates of live birth (353 vs 220 per 1000 women) and clinical pregnancy (384 vs 224 per 1000 women), but similar miscarriage and multiple pregnancy rates; again, evidence was uncertain. The main limitations of the studies were the small study populations and the unclear reporting of methods, such as allocation concealment, random sequence generation, and/or adequate blinding of participants/carers/outcome assessors.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "ESTROGEN (estrogen): A female sex hormone produced by the ovaries as part of the menstrual cycle. It encourages an egg to mature and prepares the womb for a pregnancy. Levels vary during the menstrual cycle.\nSUBFERTILITY (subfertility): When a couple fail to conceive after having regular sexual intercourse for more than a year. \u2018Regular\u2019 is defined as two or three times a week.\nPCOS (pcos): A condition which can affect a woman\u2019s menstrual cycle, fertility, hormones and aspects of her appearance. It can also affect long-term health.\nOVULATION (ovulation): The process by which the ovaries produce and release an egg each month. Ovulation usually takes place around 10\u201316 days before a period.\nCLINICAL (clinical): pertaining to medical care\nMENOPAUSE (menopause): The time when a woman\u2019s periods stop, usually around 50 years of age. See also menstrual cycle.\nMISCARRIAGE (miscarriage): The unplanned ending of a pregnancy before 23 completed weeks.\nSYNDROME (syndrome): a condition characterized by a set of symptoms\nOHSS (ohss): A potentially serious complication of fertility treatment, particularly of IVF. Symptoms are abdominal swelling or bloating, nausea and vomiting.\nRECOMBINANT (recombinant): formation of new combinations of genes\nHORMONES (hormones): Naturally occurring substances made in the body which control the activity of normal cells. They include: follicle stimulating hormone, gonadotrophins, human chorionic gonadotrophin, luteinising hormone, estrogen, progesterone, prostaglandin.\nRANDOM (random): by chance (like the flip of a coin)\nRANDOMIZATION (randomization): chance selection",

            "llm_answer": "Letrozole is a popular choice for ovulation induction in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) who are subfertile. Compared to other agents, letrozole has several advantages:\n1. Efficacy: Letrozole has been shown to be more effective than other ovulation induction agents, such as clomiphene citrate, in achieving ovulation and pregnancy rates in women with PCOS.\n2. Fewer side effects: Letrozole is generally better tolerated than other agents, with fewer side effects such as hot flashes, mood changes, and cervical cysts.\n3. Improved ovulation rates: Letrozole has been shown to result in higher ovulation rates compared to other agents, with a higher chance of multiple follicular development.\n4. Better for obese women: Letrozole may be a better choice for obese women with PCOS, as it has been shown to be more effective in this population compared to other agents.\n5. Shorter treatment duration: Letrozole treatment courses are typically shorter compared to other agents, which can reduce the risk of multiple pregnancies and minimize the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.\nHowever, letrozole may have a lower success rate in women with severe PCOS, and it may not be suitable for women with a history of breast cancer or those at high risk of developing breast cancer. In summary, letrozole is a popular choice for ovulation induction in subfertile women with PCOS due to its efficacy, tolerability, and improved ovulation rates, especially in obese women.",

            "gold_answer": "Compared with selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERMs), letrozole may improve live birth and pregnancy rates in subfertile women with PCOS when used for ovulation induction followed by intercourse. Live birth and clinical pregnancy rates were higher with letrozole (289 vs 191 per 1000 women and 317 vs 215 per 1000 women, respectively; all results on average) when compared with SERMs (clomiphene citrate or tamoxifen, either alone or in combination with metformin, human menopausal gonadotropin or estradiol valerate). Furthermore, miscarriage rate per woman was higher with letrozole (alone or with adjuncts) than with SERMs, with little to no difference reported for miscarriage per pregnancy. Incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) and multiple pregnancy rates were similar in both treatment groups. All evidence was of high certainty. Compared with clomiphene citrate or recombinant follicle\u2010stimulating hormone, followed by intrauterine insemination, treatment with letrozole resulted in higher clinical pregnancy rates (240 vs 156 per 1000 women); however, incidence of OHSS, miscarriage, and multiple pregnancy rates were similar between groups, and evidence overall was uncertain. Very low\u2010 to low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that letrozole with or without metformin compared with laparoscopic ovarian drilling, followed by timed intercourse, led to similar rates of live birth (380 vs 229 per 1000 women), clinical pregnancy (358 vs 275 per 1000 women), multiple pregnancy, and miscarriage. Similar results were reported for rates of live birth (167 vs 167 per 1000 women), OHSS, clinical pregnancy (298 vs 343 per 1000 women), miscarriage, and multiple pregnancy rates when letrozole was compared with follicle\u2010stimulating hormone; however, evidence was uncertain. Letrozole, when compared with berberine, followed by timed intercourse, may lead to higher rates of live birth (353 vs 220 per 1000 women) and clinical pregnancy (384 vs 224 per 1000 women), but similar miscarriage and multiple pregnancy rates; again, evidence was uncertain. The main limitations of the studies were the small study populations and the unclear reporting of methods, such as allocation concealment, random sequence generation, and/or adequate blinding of participants/carers/outcome assessors.",

            "llm_answer": "Letrozole is a commonly used medication for subfertile women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) who are trying to conceive. It works by reducing the production of androgens, which can help to improve ovulation and fertility.\nCompared to other agents used for fertility treatment in PCOS, letrozole has some advantages. It has been shown to have a higher success rate in inducing ovulation and improving pregnancy rates compared to other medications such as clomiphene citrate. Additionally, letrozole has a lower risk of multiple births compared to other fertility medications.\nHowever, it's important to note that letrozole may not be suitable for all women with PCOS, and the decision to use it should be made on an individual basis with the guidance of a healthcare provider. Other factors such as age, ovarian reserve, and the presence of other medical conditions may also need to be considered when deciding on a treatment plan.\nIt's also worth noting that letrozole is not a guarantee of success, and it may take several months of treatment to achieve a successful pregnancy. It's important to discuss the potential risks and benefits of letrozole with a healthcare provider, as well as any other options that may be available, to determine the best course of treatment for an individual's specific situation.",

Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that self\u2010management may slightly improve quality of life (around 3 points on a 0\u2010to\u2010100 scale) and reduce emergency department visits (0.5 in 12 to 24 months). There was no impact of self\u2010management on respiratory\u2010related mortality, all\u2010cause mortality, all\u2010cause admissions, COPD exacerbations, or dyspnea.

Improved symptom control: Self-management techniques can help individuals better manage their symptoms, such as shortness of breath, coughing, and fatigue, which can improve their overall quality of life.\n2. Increased physical activity: Self-management programs often encourage individuals to engage in regular physical activity, which can help improve lung function and overall fitness.\n3. Better medication adherence: Self-management programs can help individuals better understand the importance of taking their medications as prescribed and adhering to their treatment plan.\n4. Reduced hospitalizations: By managing their symptoms and taking their medications correctly, individuals with COPD may experience fewer exacerbations and hospitalizations.\n5. Improved mental health: Self-management programs can also address the emotional and psychological aspects of living with COPD, such as anxiety and depression, which can improve mental health and overall well-being.\n6. Increased patient empowerment: Self-management programs can help individuals with COPD take a more active role in managing their condition, which can lead to increased feelings of control and empowerment.\n7. Better coordination of care: Self-management programs can also help individuals with COPD navigate the healthcare system and coordinate their care with healthcare providers, which can improve the overall quality of care they receive.",

Moderate\u2010quality evidence showed that this benefit was not sustained in the longer\u2010term (5 years). Low\u2010quality evidence suggests there was no benefit of an adjunctive corticosteroid in terms of reducing rates of disabling neurological deficit, ether within 24 months or at 5 years. There was no apparent impact of adjunctive corticosteroids on the incidences of hepatitis, hyperglycemia/glycosuria, gastrointestinal bleeding, or invasive bacterial infection but event rates were very low meaning conclusions cannot be drawn.",

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers found no conclusive RCT evidence suggesting that administration of probiotics to pregnant women was superior or inferior to placebo in reducing morbidity or mortality in preterm infants. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that in pregnant women who received probiotics, the risk of preterm birth (< 37 weeks) and miscarriage/stillbirth was no more or less likely compared with those who did not receive probiotics. Only one RCT (159 infants) reported no incidences of early neonatal sepsis (\u2264 3 days) in either trial arm. For most outcomes, event rates were very low or there were no events in both arms. There is a lack of data on neonatal short\u2010term (early or late sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, neonatal death, hospital stay) and long\u2010term (major neurodevelopmental disability) potential benefits or harms following probiotic administration. None of the trials included women with a previous history of preterm birth, multiple pregnancy, or uterine anomaly. Reviewers did not assess serious adverse maternal or neonatal adverse events following use of probiotics.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "RCT (rct): A study which tests the effectiveness and safety of treatments or procedures as fairly and objectively as possible. By randomly assigning patients to different treatments for the same problem, the results can be assessed equally with the aim of discovering the best possible procedure for the condition.\nPLACEBO (placebo): an inactive substance; a pill/liquid that contains no medicine\nMORBIDITY (morbidity): undesired result or complication\nMORTALITY (mortality): death\nRISK (risk): The chance that an activity or hazard will give rise to harm. Risk is generally given in terms of numerical odds (1 in 10) or percentages (10%).\nSEPSIS (sepsis): The immune system's overreaction to an infection or injury which can lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and death.\nPOTENTIAL (potential): possible\nPOTENTIATE (potentiate): increase or multiply the effect of a drug or toxin (poison) by giving another drug or toxin at the same time (sometimes an unintentional result)\nPOTENTIATOR (potentiator): an agent that helps another agent work better\nASSESS (assess): to learn about, measure, evaluate, look at",

            "llm_answer": "Yes, probiotics administered to pregnant women have been shown to help prevent morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that can help maintain a healthy gut microbiome, which is important for the development and function of various bodily systems, including the immune system.\nStudies have found that probiotics can help reduce the risk of preterm birth, which is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Probiotics have also been shown to reduce the risk of other complications in preterm infants, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious condition that can cause damage to the intestines.\nIt's important to note that not all probiotics are the same, and some strains have been found to be more effective than others in preventing morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. For example, the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any supplements during pregnancy, including probiotics, to ensure safety and effectiveness. Additionally, it's important to note that while probiotics can help reduce the risk of complications, they are not a guarantee against them, and other factors such as proper prenatal care, a healthy diet, and a safe delivery are also important for a healthy pregnancy and baby.",
