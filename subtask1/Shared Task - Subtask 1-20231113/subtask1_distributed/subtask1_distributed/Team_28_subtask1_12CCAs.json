When a composite reference standard (latent class analysis) was used for the diagnosis of enterocele, pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity were 91% and 97% for EP, 85% and 99% for MRI, and 84% and 98% for TPUS, respectively. Based on these estimates and a prevalence of 24%, the number of women wrongly diagnosed with enterocele for every 1000 women tested would be 27 with EP, 6 with MRI, and 12 with TPUS. The number of women with enterocele missed would be 21 with EP, 37 with MRI, and 40 with TPUS.

Across the five trials (382 participants), researchers reported no cases of suspected ototoxicity (very low\u2010certainty evidence). Reviewers identified single trials (57 to 60 participants) for other reported outcomes (ear pain, hearing, serious complications) and no trials reporting resolution of ear discharge after four weeks or quality of life.",

            "llm_answer": "I cannot provide medical advice or make recommendations for specific treatments. However, I can provide some general information on the topic.\nChronic suppurative otitis media is a condition where the middle ear becomes chronically infected and drains pus. Topical quinolones and systemic antibiotics are two common treatment options for this condition.\nTopical quinolones are antibiotic drops that are applied directly to the ear canal. They work by killing the bacteria that cause the infection and can be effective in treating chronic suppurative otitis media. However, they may not be as effective as systemic antibiotics in treating more severe cases of the condition.\nSystemic antibiotics, on the other hand, are medications that are taken orally and work throughout the body. They can be effective in treating chronic suppurative otitis media by targeting the underlying infection and reducing inflammation. However, they may have more side effects compared to topical quinolones.\nIt's important to note that the choice between topical quinolones and systemic antibiotics depends on the severity and duration of the infection, as well as the individual's medical history and other health factors. It's best to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the most appropriate treatment plan.\nIn summary, both topical quinolones and systemic antibiotics can be effective in treating chronic suppurative otitis media, but the choice between the two depends on the individual case and should be made under the guidance of a healthcare professional.",

There may be little to no difference between groups in retinopathy of prematurity requiring treatment or in bronchopulmonary dysplasia; results for necrotizing enterocolitis were imprecise. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that fewer infants may have invasive infection with topical oil than with routine skin care, but event rates were low in both groups (10 vs 14 per 1000 infants). Mortality rates were similar between groups. Rate of weight gain and change in crown\u2010to\u2010heel length were greater with topical oil. Neurodevelopmental delay, necrotizing enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia were assessed in few infants.",

            "gold_answer": "Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that application of topical water\u2010in\u2010oil emollient to preterm infants' skin may be less effective than routine skin care for reducing neonatal invasive infection (274 vs 243 infections per 1000 infants; all results on average); however, evidence suggests mortality may be lower with emollient use (105 vs 121 per 1000 infants). There may be little to no difference between groups in retinopathy of prematurity requiring treatment or in bronchopulmonary dysplasia; results for necrotizing enterocolitis were imprecise. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that fewer infants may have invasive infection with topical oil than with routine skin care, but event rates were low in both groups (10 vs 14 per 1000 infants). Mortality rates were similar between groups. Rate of weight gain and change in crown\u2010to\u2010heel length were greater with topical oil. Neurodevelopmental delay, necrotizing enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia were assessed in few infants.",

Low\u2010 to very low\u2010certainty evidence suggests little to no difference between SLIT and placebo or usual care for reducing instances of asthma exacerbation requiring hospital visits, oral corticosteroids, or inhaled corticosteroid use. Asthma symptoms were reportedly improved with SLIT in 19 of 24 RCTs; however, studies were at high risk of bias. No firm conclusions on quality of life could be drawn, as assessment measures were heterogeneous and were at high risk of bias. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows little to no difference in serious adverse event rates between treatment groups; however, when all adverse events were considered, high\u2010certainty evidence shows more instances among those receiving SLIT (on average, 771 vs 628 per 1000 people).",

SLIT involves placing a small amount of an allergen extract under the tongue, where it dissolves and is absorbed into the bloodstream, stimulating an immune response that can help desensitize the body to specific allergens.\nOne meta-analysis of 15 randomized controlled trials found that SLIT significantly reduced asthma symptoms and medication use compared to placebo or usual care. Another review of 23 studies found that SLIT was associated with a significant reduction in asthma exacerbations and hospitalizations.\nHowever, it's important to note that SLIT is not suitable for everyone with asthma, and its effectiveness may vary depending on the individual's specific allergies and severity of asthma.

            "gold_answer": "Most RCT evidence comparing sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) with placebo or usual care for adults, teenagers, and children with asthma with or without rhinitis was underpowered and uncertain; therefore, no firm conclusions can be drawn. Low\u2010 to very low\u2010certainty evidence suggests little to no difference between SLIT and placebo or usual care for reducing instances of asthma exacerbation requiring hospital visits, oral corticosteroids, or inhaled corticosteroid use. Asthma symptoms were reportedly improved with SLIT in 19 of 24 RCTs; however, studies were at high risk of bias. No firm conclusions on quality of life could be drawn, as assessment measures were heterogeneous and were at high risk of bias. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows little to no difference in serious adverse event rates between treatment groups; however, when all adverse events were considered, high\u2010certainty evidence shows more instances among those receiving SLIT (on average, 771 vs 628 per 1000 people).",
            "gold_answer_terms": "RCT (rct): A study which tests the effectiveness and safety of treatments or procedures as fairly and objectively as possible. By randomly assigning patients to different treatments for the same problem, the results can be assessed equally with the aim of discovering the best possible procedure for the condition.\nIMMUNOTHERAPY (immunotherapy): giving of drugs to help the body's immune (protective) system; usually used to destroy cancer cells\nPLACEBO (placebo): an inactive substance; a pill/liquid that contains no medicine\nASTHMA (asthma): lung disease associated with tightening of air passages, making breathing difficult\nCORTICOSTEROIDS (corticosteroids): A group of hormones which may be used to suppress the body\u2019s immune response or to reduce inflammation. Also used during pregnancy in women who are thought may have their baby prematurely. They reduce the chance of the baby having problems from being born prematurely. See also steroids.\nSYMPTOM (symptom): A specific medical sign of a condition, illness or disease.\nRISK (risk): The chance that an activity or hazard will give rise to harm. Risk is generally given in terms of numerical odds (1 in 10) or percentages (10%).\nASSESS (assess): to learn about, measure, evaluate, look at",

            "llm_answer": "Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) is a form of allergy treatment that involves placing a small amount of an allergen under the tongue to build tolerance and reduce symptoms. When compared to placebo or usual care, SLIT has been shown to be effective in reducing symptoms and medication use in people with asthma.\nA systematic review and meta-analysis published in the Cochrane Library found that SLIT significantly reduced asthma symptoms and medication use compared to placebo or usual care in patients with asthma. The review included 17 randomized controlled trials and found that SLIT was generally well-tolerated and safe.\nAnother study published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology found that SLIT was effective in reducing asthma exacerbations and improving quality of life in patients with allergic asthma.\nIt's important to note that SLIT should only be prescribed and monitored by a healthcare professional, as it can cause side effects and may not be suitable for everyone. Additionally, it's important to note that SLIT is not a replacement for standard asthma treatment, but rather a complementary therapy that can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life.\nIn summary, the evidence suggests that SLIT is a safe and effective treatment option for people with asthma, when compared to placebo or usual care. However, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional to determine if SLIT is appropriate for your specific needs and to ensure proper monitoring and treatment.",

            "gold_answer": "For adults with coronary artery disease and depression, pharmacological treatment may be beneficial for reducing depression symptoms and increasing depression remission; however, the evidence is sparse due to the low number of trials and heterogeneity of the examined populations and interventions. Pharmacological intervention may have a large effect on end\u2010of\u2010treatment depression symptoms (low\u2010certainty evidence), and also probably results in a moderate to large increase in depression remission (375 vs 225 per 1000 people; all results on average; moderate\u2010certainty evidence), when compared with placebo. Little to no beneficial effects were consistently observed for mortality and cardiac events with pharmacological treatment compared with placebo, and the evidence was very uncertain for end\u2010of\u2010treatment effects on all\u2010cause mortality and myocardial infarction. RCT evidence suggests a benefit for short\u2010term hospitalizations with pharmacologic therapy (291 vs 415 per 1000 people), and evidence from a single RCT demonstrated better short\u2010term physical quality of life, medium\u2010term physical quality of life, and short\u2010term psychological quality of life with pharmacologic therapy compared with placebo (assessed using the WHOQOL\u2010BREF).

The review found that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) were more effective than placebo in reducing depressive symptoms, but the effect size was small. However, the review also noted that the studies were limited by methodological limitations and that further research is needed to determine the optimal treatment approach for this patient population. Therefore, it is important to carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks of pharmacological treatment for depression in patients with CAD and comorbid depression, and to consider other treatment options such as psychotherapy and lifestyle modifications.",

            "gold_answer": "For adults with coronary artery disease and depression, pharmacological treatment may be beneficial for reducing depression symptoms and increasing depression remission; however, the evidence is sparse due to the low number of trials and heterogeneity of the examined populations and interventions. Pharmacological intervention may have a large effect on end\u2010of\u2010treatment depression symptoms (low\u2010certainty evidence), and also probably results in a moderate to large increase in depression remission (375 vs 225 per 1000 people; all results on average; moderate\u2010certainty evidence), when compared with placebo. Little to no beneficial effects were consistently observed for mortality and cardiac events with pharmacological treatment compared with placebo, and the evidence was very uncertain for end\u2010of\u2010treatment effects on all\u2010cause mortality and myocardial infarction. RCT evidence suggests a benefit for short\u2010term hospitalizations with pharmacologic therapy (291 vs 415 per 1000 people), and evidence from a single RCT demonstrated better short\u2010term physical quality of life, medium\u2010term physical quality of life, and short\u2010term psychological quality of life with pharmacologic therapy compared with placebo (assessed using the WHOQOL\u2010BREF).

Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that probably fewer people who received antibiotics failed to achieve clinical remission and response at 12 months (733 vs 857 and 521 vs 790 per 1000 people, respectively). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests minimal to no important effect of antibiotics on serious adverse events or withdrawals due to adverse events, although the effect is very imprecise.

            "llm_answer": "Antibiotics can have both positive and negative effects on the induction and maintenance of remission in people with ulcerative colitis (UC).\nPositive effects:\n1. Induction of remission: Antibiotics can help reduce inflammation in the colon and induce remission in people with active UC.\n2. Maintenance of remission: Antibiotics can help maintain remission by suppressing the growth of harmful bacteria and promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria in the colon.\n3. Reduced risk of complications: Antibiotics can reduce the risk of complications such as pouchitis, which is a common complication of UC that can lead to inflammation and narrowing of the pouch.\nNegative effects:\n1. Increased risk of antibiotic resistance: Long-term use of antibiotics can lead to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which can make infections harder to treat.\n2. Side effects: Antibiotics can cause a range of side effects, including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and allergic reactions.\n3. Impact on gut health: Antibiotics can disrupt the balance of gut bacteria, which can lead to changes in the gut microbiome and potentially worsen symptoms of UC.\nIt's important to note that the use of antibiotics for the induction and maintenance of remission in UC should be carefully considered and monitored by a healthcare professional. The choice of antibiotic and duration of treatment will depend on the severity and location of the disease, as well as the individual's medical history and response to previous treatments.",

Moderate\u2010quality evidence showed that this benefit was not sustained in the longer\u2010term (5 years). Low\u2010quality evidence suggests there was no benefit of an adjunctive corticosteroid in terms of reducing rates of disabling neurological deficit, ether within 24 months or at 5 years. There was no apparent impact of adjunctive corticosteroids on the incidences of hepatitis, hyperglycemia/glycosuria, gastrointestinal bleeding, or invasive bacterial infection but event rates were very low meaning conclusions cannot be drawn.",

Studies have consistently demonstrated that corticosteroids reduce the risk of death and disability in patients with tuberculous meningitis, particularly in those with severe disease. The use of corticosteroids has been associated with a significant reduction in mortality rates, from approximately 30-40% in untreated patients to around 10-20% in patients receiving corticosteroids. Additionally, corticosteroids have been shown to reduce the risk of long-term disability, such as hearing loss and cognitive impairment. However, the optimal dosage and duration of corticosteroid therapy for tuberculous meningitis are still uncertain and require further research.",

Moderate\u2010quality evidence showed that this benefit was not sustained in the longer\u2010term (5 years). Low\u2010quality evidence suggests there was no benefit of an adjunctive corticosteroid in terms of reducing rates of disabling neurological deficit, ether within 24 months or at 5 years. There was no apparent impact of adjunctive corticosteroids on the incidences of hepatitis, hyperglycemia/glycosuria, gastrointestinal bleeding, or invasive bacterial infection but event rates were very low meaning conclusions cannot be drawn.",

Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that in pregnant women who received probiotics, the risk of preterm birth (< 37 weeks) and miscarriage/stillbirth was no more or less likely compared with those who did not receive probiotics. Only one RCT (159 infants) reported no incidences of early neonatal sepsis (\u2264 3 days) in either trial arm. For most outcomes, event rates were very low or there were no events in both arms. There is a lack of data on neonatal short\u2010term (early or late sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, neonatal death, hospital stay) and long\u2010term (major neurodevelopmental disability) potential benefits or harms following probiotic administration. None of the trials included women with a previous history of preterm birth, multiple pregnancy, or uterine anomaly.

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers found no conclusive RCT evidence suggesting that administration of probiotics to pregnant women was superior or inferior to placebo in reducing morbidity or mortality in preterm infants. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that in pregnant women who received probiotics, the risk of preterm birth (< 37 weeks) and miscarriage/stillbirth was no more or less likely compared with those who did not receive probiotics. Only one RCT (159 infants) reported no incidences of early neonatal sepsis (\u2264 3 days) in either trial arm. For most outcomes, event rates were very low or there were no events in both arms. There is a lack of data on neonatal short\u2010term (early or late sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, neonatal death, hospital stay) and long\u2010term (major neurodevelopmental disability) potential benefits or harms following probiotic administration. None of the trials included women with a previous history of preterm birth, multiple pregnancy, or uterine anomaly. Reviewers did not assess serious adverse maternal or neonatal adverse events following use of probiotics.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "RCT (rct): A study which tests the effectiveness and safety of treatments or procedures as fairly and objectively as possible. By randomly assigning patients to different treatments for the same problem, the results can be assessed equally with the aim of discovering the best possible procedure for the condition.\nPLACEBO (placebo): an inactive substance; a pill/liquid that contains no medicine\nMORBIDITY (morbidity): undesired result or complication\nMORTALITY (mortality): death\nRISK (risk): The chance that an activity or hazard will give rise to harm. Risk is generally given in terms of numerical odds (1 in 10) or percentages (10%).\nSEPSIS (sepsis): The immune system's overreaction to an infection or injury which can lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and death.\nPOTENTIAL (potential): possible\nPOTENTIATE (potentiate): increase or multiply the effect of a drug or toxin (poison) by giving another drug or toxin at the same time (sometimes an unintentional result)\nPOTENTIATOR (potentiator): an agent that helps another agent work better\nASSESS (assess): to learn about, measure, evaluate, look at",

            "llm_answer": "Yes, probiotics administered to pregnant women have been shown to help prevent morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that can help maintain a healthy gut microbiome, which is important for the development and function of various bodily systems, including the immune system.\nStudies have found that probiotics can help reduce the risk of preterm birth, which is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Probiotics have also been shown to reduce the risk of other complications in preterm infants, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious condition that can cause damage to the intestines.\nIt's important to note that not all probiotics are the same, and some strains have been found to be more effective than others in preventing morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. For example, the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any supplements during pregnancy, including probiotics, to ensure safety and effectiveness. Additionally, it's important to note that while probiotics can help reduce the risk of complications, they are not a guarantee against them, and other factors such as proper prenatal care, a healthy diet, and a safe delivery are also important for a healthy pregnancy and baby.",
