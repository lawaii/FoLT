Nine RCTs including nearly 4000 participants compared intravenous (IV) atosiban (7 RCTs), oral nolasiban, or subcutaneous barusiban (1 RCT each) versus placebo or no intervention, in either fresh or frozen IVF cycles. Based on very low\u2010 to low\u2010certainty evidence for IV atosiban and low\u2010 to high\u2010certainty evidence for oral nolasiban, there is little to no difference between groups in live birth and miscarriage rates. In contrast, comparisons showed there may be higher rates of clinical pregnancy with IV atosiban (699 vs 468 per 1000 women; all results on average; low\u2010certainty evidence) and that there are higher rates of clinical pregnancy with oral nolasiban (411 vs 357 per 1000 women; high\u2010certainty evidence) than with placebo or no intervention. There was little to no difference between groups for the subcutaneous barusiban comparison, although the evidence was very uncertain (338 vs 352 per 1000 women; very low\u2010certainty evidence). Reviewers found no difference between groups for complications associated with oxytocin antagonists, such as multiple and ectopic pregnancy, adverse effects, and congenital anomalies of the newborn, although specific data were too scarce to draw any firm conclusions.",

            "llm_answer": "Oxytocin antagonists have been studied for their potential to improve outcomes for women undergoing assisted reproduction, specifically in the context of in vitro fertilization (IVF). Oxytocin is a hormone that plays a crucial role in the reproductive process, including the release of eggs from the ovaries and the contraction of the uterus during labor. However, excessive oxytocin levels can have negative effects on fertility, such as reducing the quality of eggs and increasing the risk of complications during pregnancy.\nOxytocin antagonists are drugs that block the action of oxytocin, and some research suggests that they may improve outcomes for women undergoing IVF by reducing the levels of oxytocin in the body. A systematic review and meta-analysis published in the journal Fertility and Sterility found that oxytocin antagonists may improve the success rates of IVF by reducing the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), a potentially dangerous side effect of IVF treatment. However, the review also noted that the quality of the evidence was generally low and that further research is needed to confirm these findings.\nIt's important to note that the use of oxytocin antagonists in IVF is still a relatively new area of research, and more studies are needed to fully understand its effects and potential risks. Additionally, the decision to use oxytocin antagonists during IVF should be made on a case-by-case basis, in consultation with a qualified healthcare provider, and based on individual patient needs and circumstances.\nIn summary, while some research suggests that oxytocin antagonists may improve outcomes for women undergoing IVF, more research is needed to confirm these findings and to fully understand the potential risks and benefits of this treatment approach. It's important to discuss any questions or concerns with a qualified healthcare provider.",

            "gold_answer": "Demographic, systemic, ocular, and lifestyle prognostic factors were evaluated among people with type 1 DM (T1DM) or type 2 DM (T2DM) and DR for 1 to 25 years. A high glycated hemoglobin, evidence of existing kidney damage such as elevated albumin\u2010creatinine ratio, and basal DR severity are probably associated with progression to PDR, but gender is probably not. Age of diagnosis < 12 years, high triglyceride levels, larger central retinal venular diameter, and increased albumin excretion rate may also be associated with progression to PDR, but dyslipidemia may not be a prognostic factor. Association with other factors is uncertain. Among the demographic prognostic factors evaluated, gender is unlikely to increase the risk of developing PDR (moderate\u2010certainty evidence), but age of diagnosis < 12 years may be associated with progression to PDR in people with T1DM (low\u2010certainty evidence). However, association with other factors (ethnicity, duration of DM, type of DM, socioeconomic status, and education level) is very uncertain. Among the systemic prognostic factors assessed, glycated hemoglobin is probably associated with progression to PDR, as are albumin\u2010creatinine ratio and estimated glomerular filtration rate in people with T2DM (moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that dyslipidemia may not be associated with progression to PDR, but elevated triglycerides and albumin excretion rate may be (only in people with T1DM). Association between risk of developing or progressing to PDR and other factors (fasting plasma glucose, diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, total cholesterol, low\u2010density lipoprotein cholesterol, high\u2010density lipoprotein cholesterol, nephropathy, proteinuria, and creatinine) is very uncertain. Among the ocular prognostic factors evaluated, basal DR severity is probably associated with risk of progression to PDR (moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that larger central retinal venular diameter may also be associated with increased risk in people with T1DM (low\u2010certainty evidence). Association with other factors (basal DR features and intraocular pressure) is very uncertain. Association between risk of developing PDR and all lifestyle prognostic factors evaluated (body mass index, smoking status, and alcohol consumption) is very uncertain.",

            "gold_answer": "Demographic, systemic, ocular, and lifestyle prognostic factors were evaluated among people with type 1 DM (T1DM) or type 2 DM (T2DM) and DR for 1 to 25 years. A high glycated hemoglobin, evidence of existing kidney damage such as elevated albumin\u2010creatinine ratio, and basal DR severity are probably associated with progression to PDR, but gender is probably not. Age of diagnosis < 12 years, high triglyceride levels, larger central retinal venular diameter, and increased albumin excretion rate may also be associated with progression to PDR, but dyslipidemia may not be a prognostic factor. Association with other factors is uncertain. Among the demographic prognostic factors evaluated, gender is unlikely to increase the risk of developing PDR (moderate\u2010certainty evidence), but age of diagnosis < 12 years may be associated with progression to PDR in people with T1DM (low\u2010certainty evidence). However, association with other factors (ethnicity, duration of DM, type of DM, socioeconomic status, and education level) is very uncertain. Among the systemic prognostic factors assessed, glycated hemoglobin is probably associated with progression to PDR, as are albumin\u2010creatinine ratio and estimated glomerular filtration rate in people with T2DM (moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that dyslipidemia may not be associated with progression to PDR, but elevated triglycerides and albumin excretion rate may be (only in people with T1DM). Association between risk of developing or progressing to PDR and other factors (fasting plasma glucose, diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, total cholesterol, low\u2010density lipoprotein cholesterol, high\u2010density lipoprotein cholesterol, nephropathy, proteinuria, and creatinine) is very uncertain. Among the ocular prognostic factors evaluated, basal DR severity is probably associated with risk of progression to PDR (moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that larger central retinal venular diameter may also be associated with increased risk in people with T1DM (low\u2010certainty evidence). Association with other factors (basal DR features and intraocular pressure) is very uncertain. Association between risk of developing PDR and all lifestyle prognostic factors evaluated (body mass index, smoking status, and alcohol consumption) is very uncertain.",

Waste products are then excreted as urine.\nDIAGNOSIS (diagnosis): The way a medical professional recognises a condition or disease.\nRISK (risk): The chance that an activity or hazard will give rise to harm.

            "llm_answer": "Yes, risk factors can predict the development or progression of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) in people with diabetes mellitus (DM) and diabetic retinopathy (DR).\nSeveral studies have identified risk factors that are associated with an increased risk of developing PDR, including:\n1. Duration of diabetes: The longer a person has had diabetes, the higher their risk of developing PDR.\n2. Poor blood sugar control: High blood sugar levels over time can damage blood vessels in the retina, increasing the risk of PDR.\n3. High blood pressure: Hypertension can also damage blood vessels in the retina, increasing the risk of PDR.\n4. High cholesterol: Elevated cholesterol levels have been linked to an increased risk of PDR.\n5. Smoking: Smoking has been shown to increase the risk of PDR, as it damages blood vessels and reduces blood flow to the retina.\n6. Obesity: Obesity has been linked to an increased risk of PDR, as it can lead to insulin resistance and poor blood sugar control.\n7. Family history: A person's risk of PDR may be higher if they have a family history of diabetic retinopathy.\n8. Previous history of PDR: If a person has had PDR in one eye, they are at increased risk of developing it in the other eye.\n9. Presence of diabetic macular edema (DME): DME is a complication of DR that can increase the risk of PDR.\n10. Severity of DR: The severity of DR can also predict the risk of developing PDR. People with more advanced stages of DR are at higher risk of developing PDR.\nIt is important for people with DM and DR to receive regular eye exams to monitor their condition and identify any changes in their retina that may indicate the development of PDR. Early detection and treatment of PDR can help prevent vision loss.",

            "gold_answer": "Compared with standard care for adults with COVID\u201019, high\u2010certainty evidence shows no benefit of hydroxychloroquine for all\u2010cause mortality. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows little to no likely benefit for progression to mechanical ventilation. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests little to no difference in the number of people testing negative at day 7 or day 14 and little to no difference in hospital admission (based on 465 participants; most participants were already hospitalized) or in length of hospital stay (based on 642 participants). Moderate\u2010certainty evidence appears to demonstrate higher risk of adverse events with hydroxychloroquine (on average, 632 vs 218 per 1000 people), although this result was imprecise (with potentially 107 to 782 more people experiencing an adverse event per 1000 people). Rates of serious adverse events were low in both groups (\u2264 2%; low\u2010certainty evidence). Very low\u2010certainty results for time to clinical improvement and for risk of prolongation of the QT interval were underpowered.",

            "gold_answer": "Compared with standard care for adults with COVID\u201019, high\u2010certainty evidence shows no benefit of hydroxychloroquine for all\u2010cause mortality. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows little to no likely benefit for progression to mechanical ventilation. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests little to no difference in the number of people testing negative at day 7 or day 14 and little to no difference in hospital admission (based on 465 participants; most participants were already hospitalized) or in length of hospital stay (based on 642 participants). Moderate\u2010certainty evidence appears to demonstrate higher risk of adverse events with hydroxychloroquine (on average, 632 vs 218 per 1000 people), although this result was imprecise (with potentially 107 to 782 more people experiencing an adverse event per 1000 people). Rates of serious adverse events were low in both groups (\u2264 2%; low\u2010certainty evidence). Very low\u2010certainty results for time to clinical improvement and for risk of prolongation of the QT interval were underpowered.",

The benefits of hydroxychloroquine for adults with COVID-19 include:\nBenefits:\n* Some studies have shown that hydroxychloroquine can help reduce the severity of COVID-19 symptoms and the duration of illness.\n* Hydroxychloroquine has been shown to reduce inflammation in the body, which can help improve lung function and reduce the risk of complications such as pneumonia.\n* Hydroxychloroquine has also been shown to have antiviral properties, which can help reduce the replication of the virus in the body.\nHowever, there are also potential harms associated with the use of hydroxychloroquine for adults with COVID-19, including:\nHarms:\n* Hydroxychloroquine can cause side effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and headache.\n* Hydroxychloroquine can interact with other medications, such as blood thinners, and can cause dangerous side effects in some cases.\n* There is limited data on the long-term safety of hydroxychloroquine use for COVID-19, and its effects on the heart and other organs are not well understood.\n* Hydroxychloroquine has not been shown to be effective in preventing COVID-19, and it is not a substitute for other recommended treatments such as vaccination, social distancing, and mask-wearing.\nIt's important to note that the benefits and harms of hydroxychloroquine for adults with COVID-19 can vary depending on individual circumstances, and the decision to use the drug should be made in consultation with a healthcare professional. It's also important to follow the recommended dosage and usage guidelines to minimize the risk of side effects and maximize the potential benefits.",

Disease control rates with surufatinib and SSA alone ranged from 84% to 43% versus 61% to 21% with no intervention, respectively; all results on average. Based on high\u2010 to moderate\u2010certainty evidence, SSA and surufatinib may lower hazard for progression (median progression\u2010free survival was 10 and 9 months, respectively, vs 3 months with no intervention). SSAs achieved the greatest effect on the quality of life, and surufatinib showed the highest number of both grade 1 to 4 and serious adverse events (grade 3 to 4). Moreover, interferon plus SSAs showed the lowest number of both grade 1 to 4 and serious adverse events per person (evidence not GRADEd for these outcomes).",

            "llm_answer": "There is limited research comparing different therapies with placebo and with each other in people with gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors (gNETs). However, some studies suggest that certain therapies may have benefits in terms of symptom control and survival.\nFor example, somatostatin analogs, such as octreotide and lanreotide, have been shown to be effective in controlling symptoms such as diarrhea, flushing, and abdominal pain in people with gNETs. These therapies work by reducing the release of hormones and slowing the growth of tumors.\nOther therapies that have been studied in gNETs include chemotherapy, targeted therapies, and immunotherapy. Chemotherapy has been shown to be effective in shrinking tumors and improving survival in some people with gNETs, but it can have significant side effects. Targeted therapies, such as everolimus and sunitinib, have also been shown to be effective in some people with gNETs, but they can have side effects and may not work for everyone. Immunotherapy, such as checkpoint inhibitors, has shown promise in treating gNETs, but more research is needed to determine its effectiveness.\nIt's important to note that the most effective therapy for a person with gNETs will depend on the specific type and location of their tumor, as well as their overall health and medical history. It's important for people with gNETs to discuss their treatment options with their healthcare provider and develop a personalized treatment plan.\nIn summary, while there is limited research comparing different therapies with placebo and with each other in people with gNETs, somatostatin analogs have been shown to be effective in controlling symptoms, and chemotherapy, targeted therapies, and immunotherapy may be effective in some people. The most effective therapy will depend on the individual patient's specific needs and circumstances.",

Disease control rates with surufatinib and SSA alone ranged from 84% to 43% versus 61% to 21% with no intervention, respectively; all results on average. Based on high\u2010 to moderate\u2010certainty evidence, SSA and surufatinib may lower hazard for progression (median progression\u2010free survival was 10 and 9 months, respectively, vs 3 months with no intervention). SSAs achieved the greatest effect on the quality of life, and surufatinib showed the highest number of both grade 1 to 4 and serious adverse events (grade 3 to 4). Moreover, interferon plus SSAs showed the lowest number of both grade 1 to 4 and serious adverse events per person (evidence not GRADEd for these outcomes).",

However, it's important to note that the effectiveness of a therapy can depend on various factors, such as the type and stage of the tumor, the patient's overall health, and other individual factors.\nThere have been some studies that have compared the effectiveness of different therapies for gNETs, but it's important to keep in mind that these studies may have limitations and the results may not be generalizable to all patients. Additionally, it's important to consult with a qualified healthcare professional to determine the best course of treatment for an individual patient.\nThat being said, here are some general observations that have been reported in the literature:\n1. Surgery: Surgery is often the first line of treatment for gNETs that are localized and resectable. Studies have shown that surgery can be effective in removing the tumor and improving symptoms in these patients.\n2. Chemotherapy: Chemotherapy may be used in patients with advanced or metastatic gNETs. Some studies have shown that chemotherapy can improve progression-free survival and overall survival in these patients. However, the response rate to chemotherapy can vary depending on the type of chemotherapy and the patient population.\n3. Targeted therapies: Targeted therapies, such as everolimus and sunitinib, have been approved for the treatment of gNETs. These therapies target specific molecules involved in the growth and progression of gNETs. Some studies have shown that these therapies can improve progression-free survival and overall survival in patients with advanced gNETs.\n4. Immunotherapy: Immunotherapy, such as checkpoint inhibitors, has been used in patients with gNETs. Some studies have shown that immunotherapy can be effective in patients with advanced gNETs, but the response rate can vary depending on the type of immunotherapy and the patient population.\n5. Placebo: Placebo has been used in some clinical trials as a control arm to compare the effectiveness of different therap",

Studies have consistently demonstrated that LDCT screening leads to a significant reduction in lung cancer mortality, with a relative risk reduction of 15-20% compared to no screening. Additionally, LDCT screening can help identify other lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pulmonary embolism, allowing for earlier intervention and management.

            "gold_answer": "For asymptomatic adults with a history of smoking, moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that compared with control (no screening or annual chest X\u2010ray), lung cancer screening with LDCT probably results in lower lung cancer\u2010related mortality (13 vs 17 per 1000 people, all results on average) and lower all\u2010cause mortality (71 vs 75 per 1000 people). However, probably more people underwent invasive tests, including thoracotomy, bronchoscopy, and biopsies, with LDCT than with control (77 vs 29 per 1000 people), and more people went through invasive tests due to false\u2010positive results from LDCT (17 vs 4 per 1000 people). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests there is a small reduction in anxiety scores with LDCT compared with control, and a risk of detecting lung cancers that may have never progressed (overdiagnosis) of 18%, although this effect was imprecise.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "ASYMPTOMATIC (asymptomatic): without symptoms\nSCREENING (screening): A test or set of tests to check for a condition in a person who shows no symptoms, but who may be at risk (perhaps because of their age or sexual behaviour, for example).\nCANCER (cancer): A disease of the cells.\nMORTALITY (mortality): death\nINVASIVE (invasive): A medical procedure when a cut is made to the body or an instrument is inserted.\nTESTES (testes): male sex glands\nBIOPSY (biopsy): The taking of a small sample of tissue for examination.\nRISK (risk): The chance that an activity or hazard will give rise to harm. Risk is generally given in terms of numerical odds (1 in 10) or percentages (10%).",

Studies have consistently demonstrated that LDCT screening can detect lung cancer at an early stage, when it is more treatable, and can reduce the risk of death from lung cancer by 15-20% compared to standard chest X-rays. Additionally, LDCT screening can also help to identify other lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema, which can be treated earlier and more effectively.\nIt is important to note that LDCT screening is not recommended for everyone and should only be considered for high-risk individuals, such as those who are over the age of 55, have a history of smoking, and have a 30-pack-year history of smoking. It is also important to ensure that the screening is done at a qualified facility and that the individual is informed of the potential risks and benefits of the screening.\nIt is also important to note that while LDCT screening can improve outcomes, it is not a substitute for quitting smoking, and individuals who are eligible for screening should be encouraged to quit smoking to further reduce their risk of lung cancer.",

            "gold_answer": "Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that for adults with cancer (mean age 55 years; 80% female), music interventions provided in addition to standard care may result in a small reduction in fatigue, compared with standard care alone. Music interventions could include interactive music making, music\u2010guided imagery, music\u2010guided relaxation, performance of patient\u2010selected music by the music therapist, music listening and processing of emotions, combined interactive music making and listening to live music, vibro\u2010acoustic therapy, music video making, or music medicine (listening to pre\u2010recorded music offered by a medical professional). The addition of music interventions to standard care may also result in moderate to small reductions in depression and anxiety, moderate improvements in hope and a large reduction in pain, but the certainty of evidence for these outcomes is very low. Music interventions plus standard care may be no more effective than standard care alone for improving mood and quality of life (very low\u2010certainty evidence).",

            "gold_answer": "Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that for adults with cancer (mean age 55 years; 80% female), music interventions provided in addition to standard care may result in a small reduction in fatigue, compared with standard care alone. Music interventions could include interactive music making, music\u2010guided imagery, music\u2010guided relaxation, performance of patient\u2010selected music by the music therapist, music listening and processing of emotions, combined interactive music making and listening to live music, vibro\u2010acoustic therapy, music video making, or music medicine (listening to pre\u2010recorded music offered by a medical professional). The addition of music interventions to standard care may also result in moderate to small reductions in depression and anxiety, moderate improvements in hope and a large reduction in pain, but the certainty of evidence for these outcomes is very low. Music interventions plus standard care may be no more effective than standard care alone for improving mood and quality of life (very low\u2010certainty evidence).",

            "llm_answer": "Music interventions have been shown to have positive effects on both psychological and physical outcomes for adults with cancer. Studies have found that music can help reduce anxiety, depression, and stress, as well as alleviate symptoms such as pain, nausea, and fatigue. Additionally, music has been found to improve mood, overall quality of life, and cognitive function in cancer patients.\nOne study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology found that patients who received music therapy had significantly lower levels of anxiety and depression, as well as improved sleep quality, compared to those who did not receive music therapy. Another study published in the Journal of Music Therapy found that music listening was associated with reduced pain and improved mood in patients with advanced cancer.\nIt's thought that music may have these positive effects by providing a sense of control, relaxation, and emotional expression, as well as by stimulating the release of endorphins and other neurotransmitters that can help alleviate symptoms.\nIt's important to note that while music interventions have been found to be beneficial for cancer patients, the specific type and dosage of music used can impact the results. Some studies have used music therapy, which involves a trained music therapist working with the patient to create personalized music experiences, while others have used pre-recorded music or music listening programs. Further research is needed to determine the most effective types and dosages of music interventions for cancer patients.\nOverall, music interventions have shown promise in improving psychological and physical outcomes for adults with cancer, and may be a useful addition to traditional cancer treatment.",

Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that can help maintain a healthy gut microbiome, which is important for the development and function of various bodily systems, including the immune system.\nStudies have found that probiotics can help reduce the risk of preterm birth, which is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Probiotics have also been shown to reduce the risk of other complications in preterm infants, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious condition that can cause damage to the intestines.\nIt's important to note that not all probiotics are the same, and some strains have been found to be more effective than others in preventing morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. For example, the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any supplements during pregnancy, including probiotics, to ensure safety and effectiveness. Additionally, it's important to note that while probiotics can help reduce the risk of complications, they are not a guarantee against them, and other factors such as proper prenatal care, a healthy diet, and a safe delivery are also important for a healthy pregnancy and baby.",
