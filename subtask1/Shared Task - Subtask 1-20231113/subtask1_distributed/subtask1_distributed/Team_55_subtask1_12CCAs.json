            "gold_answer": "For patients with hematologic malignancy, doing aerobic exercises leads to improved quality of life, with reduced incidence of depression, improved fatigue, and no apparent increase in adverse events. However, data show little to no difference in mortality. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests little to no difference in mortality in the group of adults with hematologic malignancy who did physical exercise (aerobic and endurance/strength training) compared with those who did not exercise (on average, 123 vs 112 per 1000 people). Trial results show no clear differences between groups in overall quality of life (QoL), including in the specific QoL domains of physical functioning and anxiety. However, people who exercised showed modest improvement in the QoL domain of depression, as suggested by low\u2010certainty evidence. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that fatigue was somewhat improved with exercise. In terms of rates of severe adverse events (severe bleeding, fever, hyponatremia, pneumonia, hyperglycemia, deep vein thrombosis, infection, and neutropenia), little to no difference between groups was noted (116 vs 83 per 1000 people).",

Improved cardiovascular health: Aerobic exercise can help improve cardiovascular health by increasing cardiac output, reducing systemic vascular resistance, and improving oxygen delivery to tissues.\n2. Enhanced lung function: Aerobic exercise can help improve lung function by increasing lung volume and capacity, which can be particularly beneficial for patients with hematologic malignancies who may have lung damage or dysfunction.\n3. Increased muscle strength and endurance: Aerobic exercise can help improve muscle strength and endurance, which can be helpful for patients who may experience fatigue or muscle weakness due to their illness or treatment.\n4. Improved bone density: Aerobic exercise, such as weight-bearing activities like walking or running, can help improve bone density, which can be beneficial for patients with hematologic malignancies who may be at risk for osteoporosis or bone fractures.\n5. Reduced symptoms of depression and anxiety: Aerobic exercise has been shown to have a positive impact on mental health, reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety, which are common among patients with hematologic malignancies.\n6. Improved overall quality of life: Aerobic exercise can help improve overall quality of life by reducing fatigue, improving sleep, and increasing energy levels, which can be beneficial for patients with hematologic malignancies who may experience a range of symptoms due to their illness or treatment.\nIt's important to note that the benefits of aerobic exercise for adults with hematologic malignancies may vary depending on the type and stage of the disease, as well as the patient's overall health status and fitness level.

            "gold_answer": "Psychological treatments may have some benefit for adults with mild to moderate dementia; however, the available evidence is mixed. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that in adults with dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), with a focus on changing thoughts and behaviors, is probably slightly better than usual treatment for reducing depressive symptoms at the end of treatment; however, low\u2010certainty evidence suggests little to no effect on depressive symptoms in the long term. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that CBT may also increase rates of depression remission at the end of treatment compared to usual treatment (249 vs 135 per 1000 people, on average). It was uncertain if CBT had any effect on anxiety, cognition, neuropsychiatric symptoms, or caregiver depressive symptoms at the end of treatment. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that CBT probably improves quality of life and activities of daily living at the end of treatment, but this effect was not maintained at long\u2010term follow\u2010up. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that quality of life is likely better with supportive and counseling therapies than with usual treatment for adults with dementia and MCI. However, very low\u2010 to low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that supportive and counseling interventions may have little to no effect on depressive and anxiety symptoms, activities of daily living, cognition, neuropsychiatric symptoms, or caregiver depressive symptoms. Most people included in this review had mild to moderate dementia, so the results may not apply as broadly to those with MCI or to those with more severe dementia. Few studies included people who had significant depression, to whom these psychological treatments are likely to be offered in clinical practice.",

            "gold_answer": "Psychological treatments may have some benefit for adults with mild to moderate dementia; however, the available evidence is mixed. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that in adults with dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), with a focus on changing thoughts and behaviors, is probably slightly better than usual treatment for reducing depressive symptoms at the end of treatment; however, low\u2010certainty evidence suggests little to no effect on depressive symptoms in the long term. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that CBT may also increase rates of depression remission at the end of treatment compared to usual treatment (249 vs 135 per 1000 people, on average). It was uncertain if CBT had any effect on anxiety, cognition, neuropsychiatric symptoms, or caregiver depressive symptoms at the end of treatment. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that CBT probably improves quality of life and activities of daily living at the end of treatment, but this effect was not maintained at long\u2010term follow\u2010up. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that quality of life is likely better with supportive and counseling therapies than with usual treatment for adults with dementia and MCI. However, very low\u2010 to low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that supportive and counseling interventions may have little to no effect on depressive and anxiety symptoms, activities of daily living, cognition, neuropsychiatric symptoms, or caregiver depressive symptoms. Most people included in this review had mild to moderate dementia, so the results may not apply as broadly to those with MCI or to those with more severe dementia. Few studies included people who had significant depression, to whom these psychological treatments are likely to be offered in clinical practice.",

Additionally, some psychological treatments may have potential harms, such as:\n* Cognitive overload or confusion\n* Increased anxiety or frustration\n* Difficulty with implementation and adherence to treatment plans\n* Potential for misdiagnosis or inappropriate treatment\nIt's important to consult with a qualified healthcare professional to determine the best course of treatment for an individual with dementia or mild cognitive impairment.

Studies have consistently demonstrated that these treatments can reduce weight gain and improve weight-related outcomes in individuals who have quit smoking. Varenicline, in particular, has been shown to have a greater effect on weight loss compared to NRT. However, it's important to note that weight gain is still a common occurrence after quitting smoking, and a healthy diet and regular exercise are also important for maintaining a healthy weight.",

Both comparisons are limited by low\u2010certainty data, so no firm conclusions can be drawn. When cephalosporin is compared with penicillin for people with group A streptococcal pharyngitis, low\u2010certainty evidence yields an imprecise result for non\u2010resolution of symptoms, but analysis of adults only suggests that fewer participants may have non\u2010resolution of symptoms with cephalosporin than with penicillin (on average, 320 vs 377 per 1000 people). However, overall, 18% of participants were lost to follow\u2010up and assumptions made about outcomes for these people (whether or not their symptoms had resolved) had a substantial impact on the pooled result, sufficiently reducing confidence in the results for adults for evidence to be considered of very low certainty. Additionally, fewer participants given cephalosporin rather than penicillin had a relapse in symptoms (on average, 34 vs 61 per 1000), but this evidence was of low certainty. Evidence for the numbers of participants experiencing adverse events was of very low certainty. When RCTs compare macrolides with penicillin for people presenting with group A streptococcal pharyngitis, low\u2010certainty evidence suggests little to no difference between groups in non\u2010resolution of symptoms post treatment, incidence of relapse, or adverse events (such as diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, constipation, and abdominal pain).",

            "gold_answer": "For people with group A streptococcal pharyngitis, cephalosporin appears to be associated with lower rates of non\u2010resolution and relapse versus penicillin, and macrolides seem to be similarly effective as penicillin. Both comparisons are limited by low\u2010certainty data, so no firm conclusions can be drawn. When cephalosporin is compared with penicillin for people with group A streptococcal pharyngitis, low\u2010certainty evidence yields an imprecise result for non\u2010resolution of symptoms, but analysis of adults only suggests that fewer participants may have non\u2010resolution of symptoms with cephalosporin than with penicillin (on average, 320 vs 377 per 1000 people). However, overall, 18% of participants were lost to follow\u2010up and assumptions made about outcomes for these people (whether or not their symptoms had resolved) had a substantial impact on the pooled result, sufficiently reducing confidence in the results for adults for evidence to be considered of very low certainty. Additionally, fewer participants given cephalosporin rather than penicillin had a relapse in symptoms (on average, 34 vs 61 per 1000), but this evidence was of low certainty. Evidence for the numbers of participants experiencing adverse events was of very low certainty. When RCTs compare macrolides with penicillin for people presenting with group A streptococcal pharyngitis, low\u2010certainty evidence suggests little to no difference between groups in non\u2010resolution of symptoms post treatment, incidence of relapse, or adverse events (such as diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, constipation, and abdominal pain).",

            "llm_answer": "Cephalosporins and macrolides are alternative antibiotics that can be used to treat group A streptococcal pharyngitis, but they have different properties and may have different effects on different people.\nPenicillin is a beta-lactam antibiotic that is effective against many bacteria, including group A streptococci. It is often the first-line treatment for strep throat caused by this type of bacteria. However, some strains of group A streptococci have developed resistance to penicillin, which means that the antibiotic may not be effective against them.\nCephalosporins, such as cephalexin or cefadroxil, are a class of antibiotics that are related to penicillin and are effective against a wide range of bacteria, including group A streptococci. They are often used as an alternative to penicillin for people who are allergic to penicillin or who have a history of penicillin resistance. Cephalosporins are generally well-tolerated and have a similar efficacy to penicillin in treating strep throat.\nMacrolides, such as azithromycin or clarithromycin, are a class of antibiotics that are effective against a wide range of bacteria, including group A streptococci. They are often used as an alternative to penicillin and cephalosporins for people who are allergic to these antibiotics or who have a history of resistance. Macrolides have a longer duration of action than penicillin and cephalosporins, which means that they may be effective for longer periods of time. However, they may have more side effects than penicillin and cephalosporins, such as gastrointestinal upset and liver damage.\nIt's important to note that the choice of antibiotic will depend on the individual patient and the specific bacteria causing the infection. Your healthcare provider will be able to determine the best antibiotic for you based on your medical history, allergies, and the severity of your infection. It's important",

            "llm_answer": "Chest physiotherapy, also known as chest physical therapy or respiratory therapy, can provide several benefits for adults with pneumonia, including:\nBenefits:\n1. Improved lung function: Chest physiotherapy can help to loosen and remove mucus from the lungs, improving lung function and making it easier to breathe.\n2. Reduced respiratory symptoms: Chest physiotherapy can help to reduce respiratory symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath, and wheezing.\n3. Increased oxygenation: Chest physiotherapy can help to increase oxygen levels in the blood, which can improve oxygenation of the body's tissues.\n4. Reduced risk of complications: Chest physiotherapy can help to reduce the risk of complications associated with pneumonia, such as respiratory failure, sepsis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome.\nHowever, chest physiotherapy can also have some potential harms, including:\nHarms:\n1. Discomfort: Chest physiotherapy can be uncomfortable and may cause pain or discomfort, particularly if the patient has a lot of mucus or inflammation in the lungs.\n2. Fatigue: Chest physiotherapy can be tiring and may cause fatigue, particularly if the patient is already weak or debilitated.\n3. Infection: Chest physiotherapy may introduce bacteria or other pathogens into the lungs, which can lead to infection.\n4. Damage to lung tissue: Chest physiotherapy can potentially damage lung tissue, particularly if the therapy is too aggressive or if the patient has pre-existing lung disease.\nIt is important to note that the benefits and harms of chest physiotherapy in adults with pneumonia can vary depending on the individual patient and the severity of their illness. Chest physiotherapy should only be performed by a trained healthcare professional and should be tailored to the individual patient's needs and condition.",

            "llm_answer": "Chest physiotherapy, also known as chest physical therapy or respiratory therapy, can be beneficial for adults with pneumonia in several ways:\nBenefits:\n1. Improved lung function: Chest physiotherapy can help to loosen and remove mucus from the lungs, improving lung function and making it easier to breathe.\n2. Reduced respiratory symptoms: Chest physiotherapy can help to reduce respiratory symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath, and wheezing.\n3. Increased oxygen levels: Chest physiotherapy can help to increase oxygen levels in the blood, which can improve oxygenation of the body's tissues.\n4. Reduced risk of complications: Chest physiotherapy can help to reduce the risk of complications associated with pneumonia, such as respiratory failure, by improving lung function and reducing inflammation.\nHarms:\n1. Discomfort: Chest physiotherapy can be uncomfortable and may cause temporary discomfort or pain, especially if the patient has a lot of mucus or inflammation in the lungs.\n2. Infection risk: Chest physiotherapy may increase the risk of infection if not performed properly, as it can dislodge mucus and bacteria from the lungs and spread it to other parts of the body.\n3. Worsening of symptoms: In some cases, chest physiotherapy may worsen respiratory symptoms, such as cough or shortness of breath, especially if the patient has a severe case of pneumonia.\nIt is important to note that chest physiotherapy should only be performed by a trained healthcare professional, and should be tailored to the individual patient's needs and medical history. Additionally, it is important to follow proper infection control measures when performing chest physiotherapy to minimize the risk of infection.",

            "gold_answer": "According to very low\u2010certainty evidence, there were no clear differences in rates of overall or severe (grade 3 to 4) intraventricular hemorrhage, nor in severe (\u2265 stage 3) retinopathy of prematurity, between infants nursed in different head positions. Lower mortality during initial hospitalization was suggested for infants nursed in supine midline position versus those nursed in supine head rotated position (on average, 123 versus 244 per 1000 infants), although the evidence presented was of very low certainty, hence should be interpreted with caution. Reviewers found no data on long\u2010term neurodevelopmental outcomes, major neurodevelopmental disability, or cerebellar hemorrhage on brain ultrasound, and insufficient evidence from an underpowered analysis did not allow reviewers to draw conclusions about effects on cystic periventricular leukomalacia.",

            "llm_answer": "Different head positions during nursing can have varying effects on improving outcomes for preterm infants.\n1. Semi-Fowler's position: This position, where the head of the bed is elevated 30-45 degrees, is commonly used in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) for preterm infants. It helps to reduce the risk of aspiration, improve respiratory function, and decrease the work of breathing.\n2. Lateral position: In this position, the infant is placed on their side with the head, shoulders, and knees slightly elevated. This position can help improve respiratory function, reduce the risk of aspiration, and promote better oxygenation.\n3. Prone position: In this position, the infant is placed on their stomach with the head turned to the side. The prone position can help improve respiratory function and reduce the risk of aspiration, but it may increase the risk of developmental delays and flat head syndrome.\n4. Upright position: In this position, the infant is placed in a semi-upright position, with the head and body elevated. This position can help improve respiratory function, reduce the risk of aspiration, and promote better oxygenation.\nIt's important to note that the choice of head position during nursing should be individualized based on the infant's medical condition, gestational age, and other factors. Healthcare providers should be consulted to determine the most appropriate head position for each preterm infant.",

            "gold_answer": "According to very low\u2010certainty evidence, there were no clear differences in rates of overall or severe (grade 3 to 4) intraventricular hemorrhage, nor in severe (\u2265 stage 3) retinopathy of prematurity, between infants nursed in different head positions. Lower mortality during initial hospitalization was suggested for infants nursed in supine midline position versus those nursed in supine head rotated position (on average, 123 versus 244 per 1000 infants), although the evidence presented was of very low certainty, hence should be interpreted with caution. Reviewers found no data on long\u2010term neurodevelopmental outcomes, major neurodevelopmental disability, or cerebellar hemorrhage on brain ultrasound, and insufficient evidence from an underpowered analysis did not allow reviewers to draw conclusions about effects on cystic periventricular leukomalacia.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "STAGING (staging): an evaluation of the extent of the disease\nMORTALITY (mortality): death\nSUPINE (supine): lying on the back\nULTRASOUND (ultrasound): High-frequency sound waves used to provide images of the body, tissues and internal organs.",

            "llm_answer": "Different head positions during nursing can have a significant impact on improving outcomes for preterm infants. Here are some of the most commonly studied positions and their associated benefits:\n1. Semi-Fowler's position: This position involves elevating the head of the bed by 30-45 degrees, which can help to improve respiratory function, reduce the risk of aspiration, and decrease the work of breathing for preterm infants.\n2. Lateral decubitus position: This position involves lying on the side with the head, shoulders, and knees slightly elevated. This position can help to improve lung expansion, reduce respiratory distress, and increase the stability of the respiratory and cardiovascular systems.\n3. Prone position: This position involves lying on the stomach with the head turned to the side. This position can help to improve respiratory function, reduce the risk of aspiration, and promote better lung expansion. However, it is important to note that this position may increase the risk of developmental delays and should be used with caution.\n4. Upright position: This position involves sitting up or sitting in a semi-upright position. This position can help to improve respiratory function, reduce the risk of aspiration, and promote better lung expansion. It can also help to reduce the risk of developmental delays and improve feeding and digestion.\nIt's important to note that the best head position for a preterm infant will depend on their individual needs and medical condition. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the most appropriate position for your infant. Additionally, it's important to ensure that the infant's head and body are properly supported and that the position is comfortable and stable.",

These effects include:\n1. Improved blood flow: The warm water and minerals in balneotherapy can help to improve blood flow and reduce inflammation in the affected limbs, which can help to alleviate symptoms such as swelling, pain, and heaviness.\n2. Reduced pain: The buoyancy of water can help to reduce pain and discomfort, allowing individuals to move their limbs more easily and with less strain.\n3. Improved mobility: The warmth and buoyancy of the water can also help to improve mobility and range of motion, which can be beneficial for individuals with chronic venous insufficiency who may have limited mobility due to pain or swelling.\n4. Enhanced circulation: The minerals present in balneotherapy can help to enhance circulation, which can aid in the healing process and reduce the risk of complications such as ulcers and infections.\n5. Relaxation and stress relief: The relaxing environment of a spa can help to reduce stress and promote relaxation, which can be beneficial for overall health and well-being.\nIt is important to note that while balneotherapy can be beneficial for adults with chronic venous insufficiency, it should be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional and as part of a comprehensive treatment plan. Additionally, it is important to ensure that the water used in balneotherapy is clean and safe, and that proper hygiene practices are followed to minimize the risk of infection.",

            "gold_answer": "For children and adolescents with anxiety, cognitive\u2010behavioral therapy (CBT) is more likely to result in remission from the primary anxiety diagnosis and from all anxiety diagnoses while leading to similar levels of treatment acceptability with waitlist and no treatment (WL/NT). Compared with WL/NT, children and adolescents who receive CBT are more likely to achieve remission from their primary anxiety diagnosis immediately after treatment (486 vs 148 per 1000 children; all results on average; moderate\u2010certainty evidence) and up to 6 months post intervention (522 vs 91 per 1000 children). These results seemed to be sustained at 6 to 12 months, although lack of power in the analyses meant differences between groups did not reach statistical significance (473 vs 242 per 1000 children). Likewise, remission from all anxiety diagnoses is more likely following CBT than with WL/NT post treatment (435 vs 148 per 1000 children; moderate\u2010certainty evidence), but lack of power in the analyses meant reviewers could not draw conclusions about effects at later time points. A moderate reduction in anxiety symptoms as reported by the child and by parents may be more likely post CBT (low\u2010certainty evidence). Low\u2010certainty evidence also suggests there was no clear difference in treatment acceptability measured as number of people lost to post\u2010treatment assessment (94 vs 87 per 1000 children). CBT may result in a large improvement in global functioning (low\u2010certainty evidence) and may slightly reduce depressive symptoms (moderate\u2010certainty evidence) compared with WL/NT. No RCTs reported response rates or adverse events.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "REMISSION (remission): disappearance of evidence of cancer or other disease\nDIAGNOSIS (diagnosis): The way a medical professional recognises a condition or disease.\nSYMPTOM (symptom): A specific medical sign of a condition, illness or disease.\nASSESS (assess): to learn about, measure, evaluate, look at\nRCT (rct): A study which tests the effectiveness and safety of treatments or procedures as fairly and objectively as possible.

CBT can lead to significant reductions in symptoms of anxiety, improvements in functional impairment, and enhancements in quality of life. In contrast, waitlist/no treatment conditions often result in minimal improvements or even worsening of symptoms over time.

            "gold_answer": "For children and adolescents with anxiety, cognitive\u2010behavioral therapy (CBT) is more likely to result in remission from the primary anxiety diagnosis and from all anxiety diagnoses while leading to similar levels of treatment acceptability with waitlist and no treatment (WL/NT). Compared with WL/NT, children and adolescents who receive CBT are more likely to achieve remission from their primary anxiety diagnosis immediately after treatment (486 vs 148 per 1000 children; all results on average; moderate\u2010certainty evidence) and up to 6 months post intervention (522 vs 91 per 1000 children). These results seemed to be sustained at 6 to 12 months, although lack of power in the analyses meant differences between groups did not reach statistical significance (473 vs 242 per 1000 children). Likewise, remission from all anxiety diagnoses is more likely following CBT than with WL/NT post treatment (435 vs 148 per 1000 children; moderate\u2010certainty evidence), but lack of power in the analyses meant reviewers could not draw conclusions about effects at later time points. A moderate reduction in anxiety symptoms as reported by the child and by parents may be more likely post CBT (low\u2010certainty evidence). Low\u2010certainty evidence also suggests there was no clear difference in treatment acceptability measured as number of people lost to post\u2010treatment assessment (94 vs 87 per 1000 children). CBT may result in a large improvement in global functioning (low\u2010certainty evidence) and may slightly reduce depressive symptoms (moderate\u2010certainty evidence) compared with WL/NT. No RCTs reported response rates or adverse events.",

            "llm_answer": "Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has been shown to be effective in treating anxiety disorders in children and adolescents, compared to waitlist/no treatment. Numerous studies have demonstrated that CBT can significantly reduce symptoms of anxiety and improve functional impairment in youth with anxiety disorders.\nA systematic review and meta-analysis published in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry found that CBT was superior to waitlist/no treatment in reducing symptoms of anxiety and improving functional impairment in children and adolescents with anxiety disorders. The review included 24 studies that compared CBT to waitlist/no treatment and found that CBT was associated with larger effects in reducing symptoms of anxiety and improving functional impairment.\nAdditionally, a study published in the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology found that CBT was effective in reducing symptoms of anxiety and improving functional impairment in children and adolescents with anxiety disorders, and that the effects were maintained at 6-month follow-up.\nIt's important to note that while CBT has been shown to be effective in treating anxiety disorders in children and adolescents, it's not a one-size-fits-all approach. The therapy should be tailored to the individual child's needs and may involve a combination of cognitive and behavioral techniques, such as exposure therapy, relaxation techniques, and cognitive restructuring.\nIn summary, CBT has been shown to be effective in treating anxiety disorders in children and adolescents, compared to waitlist/no treatment. It's important to work with a qualified mental health professional to develop a personalized treatment plan that addresses the child's specific needs and goals.",

Both pre-emptive and post-incision use of NSAIDs/COX-2 inhibitors have been shown to be effective in reducing postoperative pain and improving outcomes. However, it is important to note that the choice between pre-emptive and post-incision use depends on various factors, including the type of surgery, the patient's medical history, and the surgeon's preference.\nPre-emptive use of NSAIDs/COX-2 inhibitors refers to their administration before surgery, typically within 1-2 hours before the procedure. This approach aims to prevent the surgical stress response and reduce the inflammatory response that occurs during surgery. Studies have shown that pre-emptive use of NSAIDs/COX-2 inhibitors can reduce postoperative pain and morphine consumption, as well as improve respiratory function and reduce the risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting.\nPost-incision use of NSAIDs/COX-2 inhibitors, on the other hand, refers to their administration after surgery, typically within 1-2 hours after the procedure. This approach aims to treat existing pain and reduce inflammation that may have developed during surgery. Studies have shown that post-incision use of NSAIDs/COX-2 inhibitors can also reduce postoperative pain and morphine consumption, as well as improve respiratory function and reduce the risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting.\nIt is important to note that both pre-emptive and post-incision use of NSAIDs/COX-2 inhibitors have potential side effects and risks, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, renal impairment, and hyperkalemia. Therefore, it is important to carefully weigh the benefits and risks of these medications and to individualize their use based on the patient's medical history, surgical procedure, and other factors.",

The accuracy of the test for detecting rifampicin resistance has been studied in several research papers.\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), the Xpert\u00ae MTB/RIF assay has a sensitivity of 87-94% and a specificity of 94-98% for detecting rifampicin resistance in patients with TB. This means that the test can correctly identify patients who are resistant to rifampicin about 87-94% of the time, and correctly identify patients who are not resistant about 94-98% of the time.\nIt's important to note that the accuracy of the test can vary depending on the quality of the sample, the type of TB, and the expertise of the healthcare provider interpreting the results. Additionally, the test is not perfect, and false negatives (a negative result when the patient is actually resistant) or false positives (a positive result when the patient is not resistant) can occur.\nTherefore, it's important to use the Xpert\u00ae MTB/RIF assay in conjunction with other diagnostic tests and clinical evaluations to ensure accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment of TB and rifampicin resistance.",

Moderate\u2010quality evidence showed that this benefit was not sustained in the longer\u2010term (5 years). Low\u2010quality evidence suggests there was no benefit of an adjunctive corticosteroid in terms of reducing rates of disabling neurological deficit, ether within 24 months or at 5 years. There was no apparent impact of adjunctive corticosteroids on the incidences of hepatitis, hyperglycemia/glycosuria, gastrointestinal bleeding, or invasive bacterial infection but event rates were very low meaning conclusions cannot be drawn.",

Studies have consistently demonstrated that corticosteroids reduce the risk of death and disability in patients with tuberculous meningitis, particularly in those with severe disease. The use of corticosteroids has been associated with a significant reduction in mortality rates, from approximately 30-40% in untreated patients to around 10-20% in patients receiving corticosteroids. Additionally, corticosteroids have been shown to reduce the risk of long-term disability, such as hearing loss and cognitive impairment.

Low\u2010quality evidence suggests there was no benefit of an adjunctive corticosteroid in terms of reducing rates of disabling neurological deficit, ether within 24 months or at 5 years. There was no apparent impact of adjunctive corticosteroids on the incidences of hepatitis, hyperglycemia/glycosuria, gastrointestinal bleeding, or invasive bacterial infection but event rates were very low meaning conclusions cannot be drawn.",

According to a systematic review and meta-analysis published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, corticosteroids reduced the risk of death and disability in patients with tuberculous meningitis by 27% and 23%, respectively, compared to those who did not receive corticosteroids. However, the review also noted that the quality of the evidence was generally low and that further research is needed to confirm these findings. It's important to note that corticosteroids should only be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional and in conjunction with appropriate antituberculous therapy.",

Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that can help maintain a healthy gut microbiome, which is important for the development and function of various bodily systems, including the immune system.\nStudies have found that probiotics can help reduce the risk of preterm birth, which is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Probiotics have also been shown to reduce the risk of other complications in preterm infants, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious condition that can cause damage to the intestines.\nIt's important to note that not all probiotics are the same, and some strains have been found to be more effective than others in preventing morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. For example, the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any supplements during pregnancy, including probiotics, to ensure safety and effectiveness. Additionally, it's important to note that while probiotics can help reduce the risk of complications, they are not a guarantee against them, and other factors such as proper prenatal care, a healthy diet, and a safe delivery are also important for a healthy pregnancy and baby.",
