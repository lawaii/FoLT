            "gold_answer": "UCTs probably increase parasite treatment and school attendance and reduce illness. Additionally, UCTs may reduce extreme poverty and increase child growth checks and dietary diversity, but may have little to no impact on health service use. Reviewers assessed the impact of UCTs aimed to reduce poverty or vulnerabilities on health service use, health outcomes, and social determinants of health in LMICs. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that UCTs probably increase the number of people receiving treatment for parasites in the prior year (absolute numbers not reported); reduce the number of people reporting illness in the prior two weeks to three months (292 vs 370 per 1000 people; all results on average); and increase the number of children attending school (803 vs 757 per 1000 children). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that providing UCTs increases slightly the number of children undergoing a growth check (468 vs 450 per 1000 children); reduces extreme poverty (819 vs 890 per 1000 people); and increases food security and household dietary diversity score in the previous week, with little to no impact on health service use. Reviewers rated the evidence for all other outcomes as of very low certainty.",

Studies have shown that UCTs can increase the likelihood of individuals seeking preventive care, such as vaccinations and prenatal check-ups, as well as reduce the likelihood of delaying or forgoing necessary medical care due to financial constraints.\nHealth outcomes: UCTs have been linked to improved health outcomes, including reduced infant mortality, improved child nutrition, and better management of chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. By addressing financial barriers to healthcare, UCTs can help ensure that individuals receive timely and appropriate care, leading to better health outcomes.\nSocial determinants of health: UCTs can also have a positive impact on social determinants of health, such as poverty, education, and employment. By providing a stable source of income, UCTs can help individuals and families meet their basic needs, reduce stress and anxiety, and invest in their health and well-being. This can lead to improved health outcomes and better overall well-being.\nIt is important to note that the effectiveness of UCTs can vary depending on factors such as the size and duration of the transfer, the target population, and the local economic and social context. Additionally, UCTs may not address the root causes of poverty and inequality, and may not be a substitute for broader social and economic policies aimed at reducing inequality and improving health outcomes.\nIn summary, UCTs have been shown to have positive effects on health service use, health outcomes, and social determinants of health in LMICs. However, it is important to consider the specific context and potential limitations of UCTs when implementing them as a policy intervention.",

Low\u2010 to very low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that prophylaxis with erythromycin 0.5%, povidone\u2010iodine 2.5%, silver nitrate 1%, or tetracycline 1% did not reduce the incidence of gonococcal, chlamydial, bacterial, or unidentified ophthalmia neonatorum within 28 days of birth in babies not at high risk for this disease. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows a modest reduction in all cases of conjunctivitis including those of a non\u2010infectious cause. Very low\u2010certainty evidence suggests little to no difference in the rate of nasolacrimal duct obstruction; no occurrences of keratitis were reported in either group.

Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows a modest reduction in all cases of conjunctivitis including those of a non\u2010infectious cause. Very low\u2010certainty evidence suggests little to no difference in the rate of nasolacrimal duct obstruction; no occurrences of keratitis were reported in either group.

            "llm_answer": "Smoking cessation can have both positive and negative effects on anxiety and depression.\nPositive effects:\n1. Reduced anxiety: Smoking can often be used as a coping mechanism for anxiety, and quitting can lead to a reduction in anxiety levels over time.\n2. Improved mood: Quitting smoking can also lead to an improvement in mood and a reduction in symptoms of depression.\n3. Increased energy: Quitting smoking can increase energy levels and improve overall physical health, which can have a positive impact on mental health.\nNegative effects:\n1. Withdrawal symptoms: Quitting smoking can lead to withdrawal symptoms such as irritability, anxiety, and depression, especially in the first few weeks after quitting.\n2. Increased stress: The process of quitting smoking can be stressful, which can exacerbate anxiety and depression.\n3. Difficulty coping: For some people, smoking is a coping mechanism for stress and anxiety, and quitting can make it more difficult to cope with these feelings.\nIt's important to note that the effects of smoking cessation on anxiety and depression can vary from person to person, and it's important to seek professional help if symptoms persist or worsen. It's also important to have a solid quit plan and support system in place to help manage the transition.",

            "gold_answer": "Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that compared with control, probably fewer people who received ChAdOx1 (Oxford\u2010AstraZeneca vaccine) had confirmed SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection (1899 fewer cases per 100,000 people; all results on average). Based on high\u2010 to moderate\u2010certainty evidence, fewer people had confirmed symptomatic COVID\u201019 with Oxford\u2010AstraZeneca, Gam\u2010COVID\u2010Vac (Sputnik V), and Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen) vaccines (1550, 930, and 1202 fewer cases per 100,000 people, respectively), and probably fewer people had severe or critical COVID\u201019 with Sputnik V and Janssen vaccines (408 and 312 fewer cases per 100,000 people, respectively). The latter outcome was not assessed for the Oxford\u2010AstraZeneca vaccine. High\u2010certainty evidence shows lower all\u2010cause mortality with Janssen (68 fewer cases per 100,000 people); however, the effect is unclear with Oxford\u2010AstraZeneca, and very uncertain with Sputnik V. Based on moderate\u2010 to low\u2010certainty evidence, there was little to no difference in serious adverse events between Oxford\u2010AstraZeneca or Sputnik V and control; no trials assessed this outcome for Janssen. High\u2010certainty evidence shows that more people receiving Janssen experienced systemic reactogenicity events (287 more cases per 1000 people) compared with control. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that people who received Oxford\u2010AstraZeneca probably had more systemic and local reactogenicity events (412 and 510 more cases per 1000 people, respectively), and people who received Janssen probably had 433 more local reactogenicity events per 1000 people than with control. No trials assessed local or systemic reactogenicity adverse events for Sputnik V.",

            "gold_answer": "Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that compared with control, probably fewer people who received ChAdOx1 (Oxford\u2010AstraZeneca vaccine) had confirmed SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection (1899 fewer cases per 100,000 people; all results on average). Based on high\u2010 to moderate\u2010certainty evidence, fewer people had confirmed symptomatic COVID\u201019 with Oxford\u2010AstraZeneca, Gam\u2010COVID\u2010Vac (Sputnik V), and Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen) vaccines (1550, 930, and 1202 fewer cases per 100,000 people, respectively), and probably fewer people had severe or critical COVID\u201019 with Sputnik V and Janssen vaccines (408 and 312 fewer cases per 100,000 people, respectively). The latter outcome was not assessed for the Oxford\u2010AstraZeneca vaccine. High\u2010certainty evidence shows lower all\u2010cause mortality with Janssen (68 fewer cases per 100,000 people); however, the effect is unclear with Oxford\u2010AstraZeneca, and very uncertain with Sputnik V. Based on moderate\u2010 to low\u2010certainty evidence, there was little to no difference in serious adverse events between Oxford\u2010AstraZeneca or Sputnik V and control; no trials assessed this outcome for Janssen. High\u2010certainty evidence shows that more people receiving Janssen experienced systemic reactogenicity events (287 more cases per 1000 people) compared with control. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that people who received Oxford\u2010AstraZeneca probably had more systemic and local reactogenicity events (412 and 510 more cases per 1000 people, respectively), and people who received Janssen probably had 433 more local reactogenicity events per 1000 people than with control. No trials assessed local or systemic reactogenicity adverse events for Sputnik V.",

            "llm_answer": "Non-replicant viral vector vaccines, such as the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines, have been shown to be highly effective in preventing severe illness and hospitalization due to COVID-19. They have also been found to be safe and well-tolerated in clinical trials, with the most common side effects being mild and temporary, such as headache, fatigue, and muscle pain.\nHowever, as with any vaccine or medication, there are potential risks associated with their use. In rare cases, non-replicant viral vector vaccines have been linked to an increased risk of blood clots and bleeding disorders, particularly in individuals with a history of these conditions. Additionally, there have been reports of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the membrane surrounding the heart) in some individuals who have received these vaccines.\nIt's important to note that the risk of these serious side effects is still very low, and the benefits of getting vaccinated far outweigh the risks for most people. By getting vaccinated, individuals can not only protect themselves from severe illness and death, but also help prevent the spread of COVID-19 in their communities, which can help protect vulnerable individuals such as older adults and those with underlying health conditions.\nIt's important to keep in mind that vaccines are thoroughly tested and monitored by health organizations and regulatory agencies, and their safety and effectiveness are continuously being monitored. If you have any concerns about the safety or effectiveness of non-replicant viral vector vaccines, it's best to discuss them with your healthcare provider.",

However, I can provide some general information on the topic you've asked about.\nCerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is a condition that affects the small blood vessels in the brain, leading to damage and inflammation. It is a common cause of cognitive decline and dementia. Antiplatelet therapy, which includes drugs such as aspirin and clopidogrel, is sometimes used to prevent cognitive decline and dementia in people with CSVD.\nThere have been some studies that have compared dual antiplatelet therapy (using both aspirin and clopidogrel) to single antiplatelet therapy (using either aspirin or clopidogrel alone) for preventing cognitive decline and dementia in people with CSVD. However, the evidence is not yet conclusive, and more research is needed to fully understand the benefits and risks of these treatments.\nOne study published in the journal Neurology in 2017 found that dual antiplatelet therapy may be more effective than single antiplatelet therapy in reducing the risk of cognitive decline and dementia in people with CSVD. However, the study also found that dual antiplatelet therapy was associated with a higher risk of bleeding complications.\nAnother study published in the journal Alzheimer's & Dementia in 2020 found that single antiplatelet therapy with aspirin may be more effective than dual antiplatelet therapy in reducing the risk of cognitive decline and dementia in people with CSVD.\nIt's important to note that these studies had a relatively small sample size and the results may not be generalizable to all people with CSVD. Additionally, the optimal dosage and duration of antiplatelet therapy for preventing cognitive decline and dementia in people with CSVD is not yet established.\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the best course of treatment for an individual patient. They will be able to consider the patient's medical history, current health status, and other factors to make an informed decision.\nIn summary, while there is some evidence to suggest that dual antiplatelet",

Improved symptom management: CBT can help individuals with schizophrenia manage their symptoms more effectively, such as reducing the frequency and intensity of psychotic episodes.\n2. Enhanced cognitive functioning: CBT can improve cognitive functioning, such as attention, memory, and problem-solving skills, which can help individuals with schizophrenia to better navigate their daily lives.\n3. Increased social functioning: CBT can help individuals with schizophrenia improve their social skills and ability to interact with others, leading to increased social functioning and a better quality of life.\n4. Reduced hospitalization rates: Studies have shown that group CBT can lead to a reduction in hospitalization rates for individuals with schizophrenia.\n5. Improved medication adherence: CBT can help individuals with schizophrenia better understand and adhere to their medication regimen, leading to improved treatment outcomes.\n6. Reduced substance abuse: CBT can help individuals with schizophrenia reduce their substance abuse, which is a common comorbidity with schizophrenia.\n7. Improved overall quality of life: CBT can lead to an improvement in overall quality of life, including better mental and physical health, improved relationships, and increased life satisfaction.\nIt is important to note that while group CBT has been shown to be effective, it is not a replacement for medication or other treatments that may be necessary for managing schizophrenia. It is typically used in conjunction with other treatments and under the guidance of a trained mental health professional.",

Reduced negative symptoms: CBT can help reduce negative symptoms of schizophrenia, such as apathy and social withdrawal, which can improve overall well-being.\n5. Improved self-esteem and confidence: CBT can help individuals with schizophrenia develop a more positive self-image and increase their self-esteem and confidence, leading to a better overall quality of life.\nIt is important to note that while CBT can be an effective treatment for schizophrenia, it is not a cure and should be used in conjunction with other treatments, such as medication and social support.

Education: FAST has been found to improve academic achievement and attainment, particularly in reading and math.\n3. Health: FAST has been linked to improved physical health outcomes, such as reduced obesity and improved nutrition, as well as improved mental health outcomes, such as reduced anxiety and depression.\n4. Family functioning: FAST has been found to improve family functioning, including increased parental involvement and support, improved communication, and reduced conflict.\nIn comparison to usual care or no intervention, FAST has been shown to have a positive impact on these outcomes, suggesting that it is a valuable intervention for improving the well-being of children and their families.\nIt is important to note that the effectiveness of FAST may vary depending on factors such as the quality of implementation, the population being served, and the specific outcomes being measured. However, overall, the evidence suggests that FAST is a promising intervention for improving behavior, education, and health outcomes for children and their families.",

The interventions evaluated included reducing the number of students and contacts (phased reopening of schools, reduced class size, staggered start/end time of school day) or reducing only the contacts (alternating attendance); making contacts safer (face masks, handwashing, cleaning interventions, modifying activities in the school setting or combined measures); surveillance and response measures (mass testing and isolation measures, symptom\u2010based screening and quarantine measures) and multicomponent measures. While these interventions may have helped improve transmission\u2010related outcomes (number or proportion of cases, risk of infection, reproduction number, deaths, shift in pandemic development, infected schools, risk of transmission to other schools), healthcare utilization (hospitalizations, intensive care) and societal and ecological outcomes (number of days in school), the true impact of these measures is very unclear, and confidence in the certainty of this evidence is very low. No study reported on potential harms of these interventions.",

The interventions evaluated included reducing the number of students and contacts (phased reopening of schools, reduced class size, staggered start/end time of school day) or reducing only the contacts (alternating attendance); making contacts safer (face masks, handwashing, cleaning interventions, modifying activities in the school setting or combined measures); surveillance and response measures (mass testing and isolation measures, symptom\u2010based screening and quarantine measures) and multicomponent measures. While these interventions may have helped improve transmission\u2010related outcomes (number or proportion of cases, risk of infection, reproduction number, deaths, shift in pandemic development, infected schools, risk of transmission to other schools), healthcare utilization (hospitalizations, intensive care) and societal and ecological outcomes (number of days in school), the true impact of these measures is very unclear, and confidence in the certainty of this evidence is very low. No study reported on potential harms of these interventions.",

Moderate\u2010quality evidence showed that this benefit was not sustained in the longer\u2010term (5 years). Low\u2010quality evidence suggests there was no benefit of an adjunctive corticosteroid in terms of reducing rates of disabling neurological deficit, ether within 24 months or at 5 years. There was no apparent impact of adjunctive corticosteroids on the incidences of hepatitis, hyperglycemia/glycosuria, gastrointestinal bleeding, or invasive bacterial infection but event rates were very low meaning conclusions cannot be drawn.",

Studies have consistently demonstrated that corticosteroids reduce the risk of death and disability in patients with tuberculous meningitis, particularly in those with severe disease. The use of corticosteroids has been associated with a significant reduction in mortality rates, from approximately 30-40% in untreated patients to around 10-20% in patients receiving corticosteroids. Additionally, corticosteroids have been shown to reduce the risk of long-term disability, such as hearing loss and cognitive impairment. However, the optimal dosage and duration of corticosteroid therapy for tuberculous meningitis are still uncertain and require further research.",

Moderate\u2010quality evidence showed that this benefit was not sustained in the longer\u2010term (5 years). Low\u2010quality evidence suggests there was no benefit of an adjunctive corticosteroid in terms of reducing rates of disabling neurological deficit, ether within 24 months or at 5 years. There was no apparent impact of adjunctive corticosteroids on the incidences of hepatitis, hyperglycemia/glycosuria, gastrointestinal bleeding, or invasive bacterial infection but event rates were very low meaning conclusions cannot be drawn.",

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers found no conclusive RCT evidence suggesting that administration of probiotics to pregnant women was superior or inferior to placebo in reducing morbidity or mortality in preterm infants. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that in pregnant women who received probiotics, the risk of preterm birth (< 37 weeks) and miscarriage/stillbirth was no more or less likely compared with those who did not receive probiotics. Only one RCT (159 infants) reported no incidences of early neonatal sepsis (\u2264 3 days) in either trial arm. For most outcomes, event rates were very low or there were no events in both arms. There is a lack of data on neonatal short\u2010term (early or late sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, neonatal death, hospital stay) and long\u2010term (major neurodevelopmental disability) potential benefits or harms following probiotic administration. None of the trials included women with a previous history of preterm birth, multiple pregnancy, or uterine anomaly. Reviewers did not assess serious adverse maternal or neonatal adverse events following use of probiotics.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "RCT (rct): A study which tests the effectiveness and safety of treatments or procedures as fairly and objectively as possible. By randomly assigning patients to different treatments for the same problem, the results can be assessed equally with the aim of discovering the best possible procedure for the condition.\nPLACEBO (placebo): an inactive substance; a pill/liquid that contains no medicine\nMORBIDITY (morbidity): undesired result or complication\nMORTALITY (mortality): death\nRISK (risk): The chance that an activity or hazard will give rise to harm. Risk is generally given in terms of numerical odds (1 in 10) or percentages (10%).\nSEPSIS (sepsis): The immune system's overreaction to an infection or injury which can lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and death.\nPOTENTIAL (potential): possible\nPOTENTIATE (potentiate): increase or multiply the effect of a drug or toxin (poison) by giving another drug or toxin at the same time (sometimes an unintentional result)\nPOTENTIATOR (potentiator): an agent that helps another agent work better\nASSESS (assess): to learn about, measure, evaluate, look at",

            "llm_answer": "Yes, probiotics administered to pregnant women have been shown to help prevent morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that can help maintain a healthy gut microbiome, which is important for the development and function of various bodily systems, including the immune system.\nStudies have found that probiotics can help reduce the risk of preterm birth, which is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Probiotics have also been shown to reduce the risk of other complications in preterm infants, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious condition that can cause damage to the intestines.\nIt's important to note that not all probiotics are the same, and some strains have been found to be more effective than others in preventing morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. For example, the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any supplements during pregnancy, including probiotics, to ensure safety and effectiveness. Additionally, it's important to note that while probiotics can help reduce the risk of complications, they are not a guarantee against them, and other factors such as proper prenatal care, a healthy diet, and a safe delivery are also important for a healthy pregnancy and baby.",
