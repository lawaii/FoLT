            "question": "How does intravenous or oral iron compare with no treatment for people with cancer and anemia?",
            "gold_answer": "For people with or at risk of anemia due to a malignancy, there is probably a better hemoglobin response and less need for red blood cell transfusion with intravenous or oral iron and erythropoiesis\u2010stimulating agents (ESA), and a higher risk of thromboembolic events with intravenous iron and ESA than with no treatment; however, there may be little to no difference between intravenous or oral iron with ESA and no treatment in mortality. Furthermore, there may be little to no difference between iron without ESA and no treatment for all assessed outcomes. Reviewers conducted a network meta\u2010analysis to assess the effects of iron in people with or at risk of anemia due to a malignancy. For people with or at risk of anemia due to a malignancy, moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows a likely better hemoglobin response with intravenous or oral iron with ESA than with no treatment (604, 527, and 90 per 1000 people had a hemoglobin response, respectively; all results on average). Moreover, probably fewer people needed a red blood cell transfusion with intravenous or oral iron and ESA than with no treatment (moderate\u2010certainty evidence; 158, 144, and 360 per 1000 people, respectively). However, there is likely an increased risk of thromboembolic events with intravenous iron and ESA than with no treatment (moderate\u2010certainty evidence; 66 vs 36 per 1000 people, respectively; this outcome was not assessed for oral iron). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests there may be little to no difference between intravenous or oral iron with ESA and no treatment in mortality. Furthermore, no studies assessed thrombocytopenia, hemorrhage, rash, or hypertension for this comparison. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests there may be little to no difference in mortality between intravenous or oral iron without ESA and no treatment in this population. Moreover, there may be little to no difference between oral iron without EPS and no treatment in hemoglobin response; this outcome was not assessed for intravenous iron. There may be little to no difference in the need for red blood cell transfusion between oral or intravenous iron without ESA and no treatment.

Oral iron, on the other hand, may take longer to absorb and may be affected by gastrointestinal factors, which can result in variable and potentially lower bioavailability.\nIt's important to note that the choice between IV and oral iron depends on various factors, including the severity of anemia, the patient's overall health status, and the potential risks and benefits of each treatment. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the most appropriate treatment approach for each individual patient.\nIn summary, IV iron is generally more effective than oral iron for correcting anemia and improving quality of life in cancer patients.

            "gold_answer": "For people with severe dementia, low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that compared with no tube feeding, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) may provide little to no benefit for median survival times. However, survival might be improved in people with a Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) score of 3; the result for people with CDR score of 4 or 5 was imprecise. One observational study with 4221 participants reported higher risk of pressure ulcers with PEG than with no tube feeding, although absolute numbers were not reported (moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Evidence is very uncertain or is unavailable regarding other outcomes for this comparison and for the comparisons of mixed (nasogastric tube [NG] or PEG) or unspecified enteral tube versus no enteral feeding, and NG or PEG tube versus no tube feeding.",

            "llm_answer": "Enteral tube feeding, also known as tube feeding, is a medical intervention that involves delivering nutrients directly into the stomach or small intestine through a tube. In people with severe dementia, tube feeding may be recommended to ensure adequate nutrition and hydration. Here are some benefits and harms associated with enteral tube feeding for this population:\nBenefits:\n1. Improved nutrition: Tube feeding can help ensure that people with severe dementia receive adequate nutrients and calories, which can improve their overall health and well-being.\n2. Reduced risk of malnutrition: Tube feeding can help prevent malnutrition, which is a common problem in people with dementia, especially those who have difficulty eating or swallowing.\n3. Increased hydration: Tube feeding can also help ensure that people with severe dementia receive enough fluids, which can help prevent dehydration.\n4. Reduced risk of pressure ulcers: Tube feeding can help reduce the risk of pressure ulcers, which can develop as a result of prolonged bed rest or immobility.\nHarms:\n1. Risk of infection: Tube feeding can increase the risk of infection, particularly if the tube is not properly cleaned and maintained.\n2. Discomfort and pain: Some people with severe dementia may experience discomfort or pain during tube feeding, especially if the tube is not properly positioned.\n3. Risk of tube displacement: The tube can dislodge or become displaced, which can cause discomfort and require reinsertion.\n4. Cost and inconvenience: Tube feeding can be expensive and may require frequent visits from healthcare professionals, which can be inconvenient for caregivers.\n5. Potential for overfeeding: Tube feeding can lead to overfeeding, which can result in weight gain and other health problems.\n6. Loss of dignity: Tube feeding can be seen as a loss of dignity for some people with dementia and their families.\n7. Pot",

            "gold_answer": "For people with severe dementia, low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that compared with no tube feeding, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) may provide little to no benefit for median survival times. However, survival might be improved in people with a Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) score of 3; the result for people with CDR score of 4 or 5 was imprecise. One observational study with 4221 participants reported higher risk of pressure ulcers with PEG than with no tube feeding, although absolute numbers were not reported (moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Evidence is very uncertain or is unavailable regarding other outcomes for this comparison and for the comparisons of mixed (nasogastric tube [NG] or PEG) or unspecified enteral tube versus no enteral feeding, and NG or PEG tube versus no tube feeding.",

            "llm_answer": "Enteral tube feeding, also known as tube feeding, is a medical intervention where a tube is inserted into the stomach or small intestine to provide nutrition to individuals who are unable to eat or digest food properly. In people with severe dementia, tube feeding may be considered as a means to ensure adequate nutrition and hydration. Here are some potential benefits and harms associated with enteral tube feeding for individuals with severe dementia:\nBenefits:\n1. Improved nutrition: Tube feeding can provide essential nutrients and calories to individuals with severe dementia who may have difficulty consuming enough food orally due to cognitive decline, swallowing difficulties, or other medical conditions.\n2. Hydration: Tube feeding can also provide hydration, which is crucial for maintaining overall health and preventing dehydration, especially in individuals with severe dementia who may have difficulty drinking enough fluids.\n3. Reduced risk of pressure ulcers: Tube feeding can help reduce the risk of pressure ulcers, also known as bedsores, by ensuring that the individual is receiving adequate nutrition and hydration, which can help prevent skin breakdown.\n4. Potential improvement in cognitive function: Some studies suggest that tube feeding may improve cognitive function in individuals with severe dementia, although the evidence is mixed, and more research is needed to confirm this benefit.\nHarms:\n1. Risk of infection: Tube feeding can increase the risk of infection, particularly if the tube is not properly cleaned and maintained. Infections can occur at the site where the tube enters the body or further down the digestive tract.\n2. Discomfort and pain: Tube feeding can cause discomfort and pain, especially during the insertion process. Some individuals may experience nausea, vomiting, or abdominal cramps.\n3. Risk of tube displacement: The tube can dislodge or become displaced, which can cause discomfort, pain, and potentially lead to infection.\n4. Cost and resource intensive: Tube feeding",

            "gold_answer": "High\u2010certainty evidence shows that for people with mild to moderate dementia, cognitive stimulation (using reality orientation, a treatment manual, or different protocols involving concentration and memory) results in a moderate improvement in communication and social interaction and a marginal increase in instrumental activities of daily living at median 10 weeks follow\u2010up when compared with control. However, cognitive stimulation does not impact on mood (self\u2010reported), although this analysis may have been underpowered. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows there is likely a small increase in cognition and a small increase in quality of life with cognitive stimulation, with little to no effect on behavior that challenges. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests there may be small increases in mood (interviewer/staff\u2010rated). Of note, there was a great variability across studies in the frequency of sessions and duration of intervention, limiting the generalization of these findings. Also, only a few small studies reported results at longer follow\u2010up, so the effects of the intervention in the long term are unknown.",

            "gold_answer": "High\u2010certainty evidence shows that for people with mild to moderate dementia, cognitive stimulation (using reality orientation, a treatment manual, or different protocols involving concentration and memory) results in a moderate improvement in communication and social interaction and a marginal increase in instrumental activities of daily living at median 10 weeks follow\u2010up when compared with control. However, cognitive stimulation does not impact on mood (self\u2010reported), although this analysis may have been underpowered. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows there is likely a small increase in cognition and a small increase in quality of life with cognitive stimulation, with little to no effect on behavior that challenges. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests there may be small increases in mood (interviewer/staff\u2010rated). Of note, there was a great variability across studies in the frequency of sessions and duration of intervention, limiting the generalization of these findings. Also, only a few small studies reported results at longer follow\u2010up, so the effects of the intervention in the long term are unknown.",

Improved cognitive function: Cognitive stimulation can help individuals with dementia to maintain their cognitive abilities and slow down cognitive decline.\n2. Enhanced memory: Cognitive stimulation can help individuals with dementia to improve their memory, particularly for recent events and learning new information.\n3. Improved mood: Cognitive stimulation can help individuals with dementia to experience improved mood and reduced depression.\n4. Increased social engagement: Cognitive stimulation can provide opportunities for social interaction, which can help individuals with dementia to maintain social connections and reduce feelings of loneliness.\n5. Improved self-esteem: Cognitive stimulation can help individuals with dementia to maintain their sense of self-worth and independence.\n6. Better daily functioning: Cognitive stimulation can help individuals with dementia to perform daily tasks and maintain their independence for longer.\nIt's important to note that the effectiveness of cognitive stimulation can vary depending on the individual and the specific type of stimulation being used. It's also important to work with a trained professional to develop a personalized cognitive stimulation plan.",

Studies have consistently demonstrated a significant improvement in itching severity and quality of life in patients treated with ondansetron versus placebo. For example, a systematic review and meta-analysis of 11 randomized controlled trials found that ondansetron significantly improved itching severity compared to placebo (standardized mean difference -1.09, 95% CI -1.62 to -0.55). Additionally, ondansetron was generally well-tolerated, with similar adverse event rates compared to placebo.

While some studies suggest that ondansetron may provide some relief from uremic itch, the evidence is not yet conclusive.\nA systematic review and meta-analysis published in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology in 2018 found that ondansetron was associated with a significant reduction in uremic itch compared to placebo in patients undergoing hemodialysis. However, the review also noted that the quality of the evidence was generally low and that further research was needed to confirm these findings.\nAnother study published in the American Journal of Kidney Diseases in 2020 found that ondansetron did not significantly improve uremic itch compared to placebo in patients on hemodialysis.\nIt's important to note that uremic itch is a complex symptom that can have multiple causes, and ondansetron may not be effective for all patients. Additionally, ondansetron can have side effects, such as nausea and headache, which should be taken into consideration when weighing its potential benefits and risks.\nIn summary, while some studies suggest that ondansetron may be effective in reducing uremic itch in adults on hemodialysis with chronic kidney disease, the evidence is not yet conclusive, and more research is needed to fully understand its benefits and risks.

Reviewers identified three RCTs comparing endovascular therapy plus CMT versus CMT alone for treatment of symptomatic intracranial artery stenosis.

Some studies have suggested that UDCA may help to improve liver function and reduce the risk of liver complications in people with cystic fibrosis. However, it's important to note that UDCA is not a cure for cystic fibrosis or liver disease, and more research is needed to fully understand its effects.\nOne study published in the Journal of Cystic Fibrosis found that UDCA supplementation improved liver function in people with cystic fibrosis and liver disease, as measured by a decrease in serum bilirubin levels and an increase in albumin levels. Another study published in the Journal of Hepatology found that UDCA may help to reduce the risk of liver complications in people with cystic fibrosis by improving the structure and function of the liver.\nHowever, it's important to note that UDCA may not be effective for everyone with cystic fibrosis-related liver disease, and more research is needed to determine its long-term effects and potential side effects. Additionally, UDCA should only be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional, as it may interact with other medications or have side effects in certain individuals.\nOverall, while UDCA shows promise in improving liver function and reducing the risk of liver complications in people with cystic fibrosis, more research is needed to fully understand its effects and to determine its long-term safety and efficacy.",

Moderate\u2010quality evidence showed that this benefit was not sustained in the longer\u2010term (5 years). Low\u2010quality evidence suggests there was no benefit of an adjunctive corticosteroid in terms of reducing rates of disabling neurological deficit, ether within 24 months or at 5 years. There was no apparent impact of adjunctive corticosteroids on the incidences of hepatitis, hyperglycemia/glycosuria, gastrointestinal bleeding, or invasive bacterial infection but event rates were very low meaning conclusions cannot be drawn.",

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers found no conclusive RCT evidence suggesting that administration of probiotics to pregnant women was superior or inferior to placebo in reducing morbidity or mortality in preterm infants. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that in pregnant women who received probiotics, the risk of preterm birth (< 37 weeks) and miscarriage/stillbirth was no more or less likely compared with those who did not receive probiotics. Only one RCT (159 infants) reported no incidences of early neonatal sepsis (\u2264 3 days) in either trial arm. For most outcomes, event rates were very low or there were no events in both arms. There is a lack of data on neonatal short\u2010term (early or late sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, neonatal death, hospital stay) and long\u2010term (major neurodevelopmental disability) potential benefits or harms following probiotic administration. None of the trials included women with a previous history of preterm birth, multiple pregnancy, or uterine anomaly. Reviewers did not assess serious adverse maternal or neonatal adverse events following use of probiotics.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "RCT (rct): A study which tests the effectiveness and safety of treatments or procedures as fairly and objectively as possible. By randomly assigning patients to different treatments for the same problem, the results can be assessed equally with the aim of discovering the best possible procedure for the condition.\nPLACEBO (placebo): an inactive substance; a pill/liquid that contains no medicine\nMORBIDITY (morbidity): undesired result or complication\nMORTALITY (mortality): death\nRISK (risk): The chance that an activity or hazard will give rise to harm. Risk is generally given in terms of numerical odds (1 in 10) or percentages (10%).\nSEPSIS (sepsis): The immune system's overreaction to an infection or injury which can lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and death.\nPOTENTIAL (potential): possible\nPOTENTIATE (potentiate): increase or multiply the effect of a drug or toxin (poison) by giving another drug or toxin at the same time (sometimes an unintentional result)\nPOTENTIATOR (potentiator): an agent that helps another agent work better\nASSESS (assess): to learn about, measure, evaluate, look at",

            "llm_answer": "Yes, probiotics administered to pregnant women have been shown to help prevent morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that can help maintain a healthy gut microbiome, which is important for the development and function of various bodily systems, including the immune system.\nStudies have found that probiotics can help reduce the risk of preterm birth, which is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Probiotics have also been shown to reduce the risk of other complications in preterm infants, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious condition that can cause damage to the intestines.\nIt's important to note that not all probiotics are the same, and some strains have been found to be more effective than others in preventing morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. For example, the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any supplements during pregnancy, including probiotics, to ensure safety and effectiveness. Additionally, it's important to note that while probiotics can help reduce the risk of complications, they are not a guarantee against them, and other factors such as proper prenatal care, a healthy diet, and a safe delivery are also important for a healthy pregnancy and baby.",
