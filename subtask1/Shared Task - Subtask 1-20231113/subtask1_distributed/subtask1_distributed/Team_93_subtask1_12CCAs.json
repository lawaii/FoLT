These drugs work by modulating the activity of GABA, a neurotransmitter that plays a role in regulating pain and itch sensations. However, the evidence for their effectiveness is not consistent across all studies, and more research is needed to fully understand their benefits and potential risks.\nKappa-opioid agonists, such as pentazocine and bremazocine, have also been investigated for their potential in treating uremic pruritus. These drugs work by activating kappa-opioid receptors in the brain, which can help to reduce itch sensations. However, their use is limited due to concerns about potential side effects, such as dysphoria, hallucinations, and dependence.\nIt's important to note that the use of GABA analogs and kappa-opioid agonists for uremic pruritus is off-label, meaning that they are not approved by regulatory authorities for this specific indication. Additionally, these drugs may have potential interactions with other medications and should be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional.\nIn summary, while GABA analogs and kappa-opioid agonists may have some potential in reducing uremic pruritus in adults with ESRD, more research is needed to fully understand their effectiveness and safety.

Reduced risk of catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs): The longer the catheter remains in place, the higher the risk of developing a CAUTI. Early removal can help minimize this risk.\n2. Decreased discomfort: Patients often experience discomfort and pain during the catheterization period. Early removal can help alleviate these symptoms sooner.\n3. Improved patient satisfaction: Early removal can lead to increased patient satisfaction and improved quality of life.\nDrawbacks of early removal:\n1. Increased risk of urinary retention: Early removal of the catheter may increase the risk of urinary retention, particularly in patients with urinary incontinence or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).\n2. Difficulty in accurately assessing urine output: Early removal can make it challenging to accurately assess urine output, which may be important in certain clinical situations.\n3. Potential for prolonged hospital stay: In some cases, early removal may require prolonged hospitalization, which can increase healthcare costs and expose patients to nosocomial infections.\nDrawbacks of later removal (beyond 48 hours):\n1. Increased risk of CAUTIs: The longer the catheter remains in place, the higher the risk of developing a CAUTI.\n2. Increased risk of catheter encrustation: Longer catheterization can lead to encrustation, which can make removal more difficult and increase the risk of complications.\n3. Increased risk of bladder dysfunction: Prolonged catheterization can lead to bladder dysfunction, which can result in urinary retention or incontinence.\nIt's essential to note that the optimal time for catheter removal depends on various factors, including the patient's medical history, clinical condition, and individual needs.",

            "gold_answer": "For adults with non\u2010ischemic cardiomyopathy, high\u2010certainty evidence shows that adding ICD to optimal medical therapy reduces the risk of all\u2010cause mortality (173 vs 216 per 1000 people, all results on average) and sudden cardiac death (34 vs 74 per 1000 people). Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that ICDs probably reduce cardiovascular mortality (127 vs 170 per 1000 people); however, the confidence interval is compatible with beneficial and harmful effects. Adding ICD to optimal medical therapy probably results in little to no absolute effect on adverse events, non\u2010cardiovascular mortality, and quality of life, but the results were imprecise. No study reported hospitalizations.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "OPTIMAL (optimal): best, most favorable or desirable\nRISK (risk): The chance that an activity or hazard will give rise to harm.

They are commonly used in people with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, a condition where the heart muscle becomes weakened or enlarged, leading to irregular heartbeats.\nThe effects of ICDs for people with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy can include:\n1. Reduced risk of sudden cardiac death: ICDs can detect and correct dangerous heart rhythms, reducing the risk of sudden cardiac death.\n2. Improved survival rate: Studies have shown that ICDs can improve survival rates for people with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy.\n3. Reduced risk of heart failure: ICDs can help prevent heart failure by regulating heart rhythms and reducing the workload on the heart.\n4. Improved quality of life: By regulating heart rhythms and reducing the risk of sudden cardiac death, ICDs can improve a person's quality of life.\n5. Reduced risk of arrhythmias: ICDs can detect and correct arrhythmias, reducing the risk of irregular heartbeats.\nIt is important to note that ICDs are not suitable for everyone with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, and the decision to implant an ICD should be made on a case-by-case basis with the guidance of a healthcare professional. Additionally, it is important to follow the manufacturer's guidelines for the use and maintenance of ICDs to ensure their effectiveness and safety.",

            "llm_answer": "Alternative modes of exercise training, such as unsupervised walking, swimming, cycling, and resistance training, can be effective for people with intermittent claudication, a condition characterized by leg pain during exercise due to reduced blood flow. These exercises can improve cardiovascular fitness, muscle strength, and endurance, which can help manage symptoms and improve overall health.\nHowever, it's important to note that alternative modes of exercise may not be suitable for everyone with intermittent claudication, and it's recommended to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new exercise program. They can help determine the most appropriate exercise plan based on individual needs and health status.\nIn comparison to supervised walking, alternative modes of exercise may offer some advantages, such as:\n1. Convenience: Unsupervised exercises can be done at home or in a local park, eliminating the need for specialized equipment or a dedicated walking program.\n2. Variety: Alternative exercises can offer a change of pace and scenery, which may help individuals stay motivated and engaged in their exercise program.\n3. Customization: Resistance training and swimming can be tailored to individual needs and abilities, allowing for a more personalized workout.\n4. Low impact: Swimming and cycling can be low-impact exercises, which may be easier on the joints and muscles compared to walking, especially for those with mobility issues.\nHowever, it's important to note that supervised walking programs often offer additional benefits, such as:\n1. Social interaction: Walking with a group can provide social support and accountability, which can help individuals stay motivated and engaged.\n2. Professional guidance: A supervised walking program can provide guidance on proper technique, pacing, and progression, which can help individuals achieve their fitness goals more effectively.\n3. Monitoring: A supervised program can monitor progress and adjust the exercise plan as needed, ensuring that individuals are challenging themselves appropriately and safely.\nIn summary, alternative modes of exercise training can be a useful addition to a comprehensive exercise program for individuals with intermittent claudication, but it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the most appropriate exercise plan",

            "llm_answer": "Pregabalin, also known as Lyrica, is a medication that is sometimes prescribed as an add-on treatment for people with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. Focal epilepsy is a type of epilepsy that affects only one part of the brain, and drug-resistant focal epilepsy refers to cases where the seizures do not respond to standard anticonvulsant medications.\nStudies have shown that pregabalin can be effective in reducing seizure frequency in people with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. In a 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis published in the journal Epilepsia, researchers analyzed data from six randomized controlled trials and found that pregabalin significantly reduced seizure frequency by 50% or more in 40% of patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy.\nHowever, it's important to note that pregabalin can have side effects, and its effectiveness can vary from person to person. Common side effects of pregabalin include dizziness, somnolence, and fatigue. In rare cases, pregabalin can cause serious side effects such as angioedema, which is a severe allergic reaction that can cause swelling of the face, lips, and throat.\nIt's also worth noting that pregabalin can interact with other medications, so it's important to inform your doctor of all medications you are currently taking. Additionally, pregabalin can cause withdrawal symptoms if stopped suddenly, so it's important to follow your doctor's instructions carefully when stopping the medication.\nIn summary, pregabalin can be an effective add-on treatment for people with drug-resistant focal epilepsy, but it's important to discuss the potential benefits and risks with your doctor and to carefully monitor your symptoms and side effects while taking the medication.",

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers identified 96 individual or combination signs and symptoms for diagnosing COVID\u201019 in people primarily presenting in outpatient settings evaluated in cross\u2010sectional studies. The WHO highlights 14 signs and symptoms associated with COVID\u201019; this CCA concentrates on the 10 most frequent (cough, fever, dyspnea, anosmia or ageusia, myalgia/arthralgia, fatigue, sore throat, headache, diarrhea, and chills/shivers) plus a further six closely related symptoms (dry cough, sputum production, hemoptysis, hypoxia, nasal symptoms, myalgia and fatigue). Overall, sensitivities were low and specificities generally moderate to high, although when multiple studies were available, estimates of sensitivity and specificity varied considerably. Reviewers concluded that most individual signs and symptoms had very poor diagnostic accuracy, and that their presence or absence is not sufficiently accurate to rule in or rule out COVID\u201019; however, the presence of anosmia or ageusia may be useful as a red flag for COVID\u201019 (average specificity 92%; high specificity helps rule in disease\u2014presence of the sign or symptom is most likely to be a true positive). On the other hand, high sensitivity helps rule out disease\u2014absence of the sign or symptom is likely to be a true negative. The presence of cough may be useful in identifying people for further testing (sensitivity 62%) but not enough sensitivity to rule out the disease.",

However, the accuracy of these symptoms may vary depending on the population being evaluated and the timing of symptom onset.\nAnother study published in The Lancet found that the accuracy of a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 based on WHO criteria was 83.6% (95% CI 78.3-87.6) in a hospital setting.\nIt's important to note that the accuracy of COVID-19 diagnosis can be improved by combining clinical evaluation with laboratory tests, such as PCR or antibody tests.",

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers identified 96 individual or combination signs and symptoms for diagnosing COVID\u201019 in people primarily presenting in outpatient settings evaluated in cross\u2010sectional studies. The WHO highlights 14 signs and symptoms associated with COVID\u201019; this CCA concentrates on the 10 most frequent (cough, fever, dyspnea, anosmia or ageusia, myalgia/arthralgia, fatigue, sore throat, headache, diarrhea, and chills/shivers) plus a further six closely related symptoms (dry cough, sputum production, hemoptysis, hypoxia, nasal symptoms, myalgia and fatigue). Overall, sensitivities were low and specificities generally moderate to high, although when multiple studies were available, estimates of sensitivity and specificity varied considerably. Reviewers concluded that most individual signs and symptoms had very poor diagnostic accuracy, and that their presence or absence is not sufficiently accurate to rule in or rule out COVID\u201019; however, the presence of anosmia or ageusia may be useful as a red flag for COVID\u201019 (average specificity 92%; high specificity helps rule in disease\u2014presence of the sign or symptom is most likely to be a true positive). On the other hand, high sensitivity helps rule out disease\u2014absence of the sign or symptom is likely to be a true negative. The presence of cough may be useful in identifying people for further testing (sensitivity 62%) but not enough sensitivity to rule out the disease.",

Additionally, it's important to remember that not everyone who has been infected with COVID-19 will exhibit all of these symptoms, and some people may experience additional symptoms not listed by the WHO.\nTherefore, it's important to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and not to rely solely on self-diagnosis based on these symptoms.\nReferences:\n1.

Although the results did not reach statistical significance, moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that antiplatelet agents probably reduce pulmonary embolism (28 fewer cases per 1000 people, respectively) and have little to no effect on major bleeding. Results on mortality, duration of hospitalization, and adverse events were imprecise. No RCT assessed post\u2010thrombotic syndromes following treatment with antiplatelet agents or placebo. Very low\u2010certainty evidence from one trial suggests that fewer people may have recurrent VTE (57 vs 460 per 1000 people) with indobufen than with no treatment. No deaths, pulmonary embolism, major bleeding, or adverse events were reported in either the indobufen or no\u2010treatment group. Moreover, post\u2010thrombotic syndrome, quality of life, and duration of hospitalization were not assessed in this trial.",

Reduced risk of recurrent DVT: Antiplatelet agents can help prevent new clots from forming and reduce the risk of recurrent DVT.\n2. Improved symptoms: Antiplatelet agents can help improve symptoms such as pain, swelling, and tenderness in the affected limb.\n3. Reduced risk of post-thrombotic syndrome: Antiplatelet agents can help reduce the risk of developing post-thrombotic syndrome, a condition characterized by chronic pain, swelling, and skin thickening in the affected limb.\n4. Reduced risk of pulmonary embolism: Antiplatelet agents can help reduce the risk of pulmonary embolism, a potentially life-threatening complication of DVT.\n5. Bleeding risks: Antiplatelet agents can increase the risk of bleeding, particularly when used in combination with other medications that also increase the risk of bleeding, such as warfarin.\nIt's important to note that the benefits and risks of antiplatelet agents for DVT prevention and treatment should be carefully weighed for each individual patient, and the decision to use these agents should be made in consultation with a healthcare provider.",

Although the results did not reach statistical significance, moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that antiplatelet agents probably reduce pulmonary embolism (28 fewer cases per 1000 people, respectively) and have little to no effect on major bleeding. Results on mortality, duration of hospitalization, and adverse events were imprecise. No RCT assessed post\u2010thrombotic syndromes following treatment with antiplatelet agents or placebo. Very low\u2010certainty evidence from one trial suggests that fewer people may have recurrent VTE (57 vs 460 per 1000 people) with indobufen than with no treatment. No deaths, pulmonary embolism, major bleeding, or adverse events were reported in either the indobufen or no\u2010treatment group. Moreover, post\u2010thrombotic syndrome, quality of life, and duration of hospitalization were not assessed in this trial.",

            "llm_answer": "Antiplatelet agents, such as aspirin or clopidogrel, are commonly used to treat deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in the chronic phase. The effects of these agents include:\n1. Prevention of further clot formation: Antiplatelet agents work by inhibiting platelet activity, which can help prevent the formation of new clots and reduce the risk of recurrent DVT.\n2. Reduction of clot size: Antiplatelet agents can help reduce the size of existing clots, which can alleviate symptoms such as pain and swelling.\n3. Improved blood flow: By preventing the formation of new clots and reducing the size of existing clots, antiplatelet agents can improve blood flow in the affected limb.\n4. Reduced risk of pulmonary embolism: Antiplatelet agents can reduce the risk of pulmonary embolism, a potentially life-threatening complication of DVT that occurs when a clot breaks loose and travels to the lungs.\nIt is important to note that antiplatelet agents are not a substitute for anticoagulation therapy, which is the primary treatment for DVT. Anticoagulation therapy, such as warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), is used to prevent the clot from growing and to prevent new clots from forming. Antiplatelet agents are typically used in combination with anticoagulation therapy to provide additional protection against clotting.\nIt is important to consult a healthcare professional before taking any medication, including antiplatelet agents, to ensure that it is safe and appropriate for your individual situation.",

General anesthesia causes a person to become unconscious and unaware of their surroundings, while non-general anesthesia, also known as regional anesthesia, numbs only a specific part of the body.\nFor adults with acute ischemic stroke undergoing endovascular treatment, the choice between general anesthesia and non-general anesthesia depends on various factors, including the severity of the stroke, the patient's overall health, and the complexity of the procedure.\nSome studies suggest that general anesthesia may be associated with a higher risk of complications and poor outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke, particularly those with severe stroke. This may be due to the fact that general anesthesia can decrease blood flow to the brain, which can worsen the effects of the stroke.\nOn the other hand, non-general anesthesia, such as conscious sedation or local anesthesia, may be associated with a lower risk of complications and better outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke. This is because these types of anesthesia allow the patient to remain awake and alert during the procedure, which can help them to communicate and respond to the medical team.\nHowever, it's important to note that the choice between general anesthesia and non-general anesthesia should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the individual patient's needs and medical history. The decision should be made by a qualified medical professional, such as an anesthesiologist, in consultation with the patient and their family.\nIn summary, while some studies suggest that non-general anesthesia may be associated with better outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke undergoing endovascular treatment, the decision between general anesthesia and non-general anesthesia should be made on an individual basis, taking into account the patient's specific needs and medical history.",

            "llm_answer": "B\u2010mode ultrasound (US) is a safe and effective guidance method for radial arterial catheterization, which is a minimally invasive procedure used to diagnose and treat various medical conditions. Compared to alternative guidance methods such as palpation and/or anatomical localization, B\u2010mode ultrasound has several advantages:\n1. Improved accuracy: B\u2010mode ultrasound allows for real-time visualization of the artery and catheter, reducing the risk of complications such as arterial puncture or bleeding.\n2. Reduced radiation exposure: B\u2010mode ultrasound does not use ionizing radiation, which can be harmful to patients and healthcare workers.\n3. Enhanced patient comfort: B\u2010mode ultrasound is non-invasive and does not require the use of radiation, which can be uncomfortable for patients.\n4. Shorter procedure time: B\u2010mode ultrasound can help guide the catheter to the target location more quickly and accurately, reducing the overall procedure time.\n5. Improved patient outcomes: By reducing the risk of complications and improving the accuracy of the procedure, B\u2010mode ultrasound can lead to better patient outcomes.\nIn summary, B\u2010mode ultrasound is a safer and more effective guidance method for radial arterial catheterization compared to alternative methods such as palpation and/or anatomical localization.",

Moderate\u2010quality evidence showed that this benefit was not sustained in the longer\u2010term (5 years). Low\u2010quality evidence suggests there was no benefit of an adjunctive corticosteroid in terms of reducing rates of disabling neurological deficit, ether within 24 months or at 5 years. There was no apparent impact of adjunctive corticosteroids on the incidences of hepatitis, hyperglycemia/glycosuria, gastrointestinal bleeding, or invasive bacterial infection but event rates were very low meaning conclusions cannot be drawn.",

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers found no conclusive RCT evidence suggesting that administration of probiotics to pregnant women was superior or inferior to placebo in reducing morbidity or mortality in preterm infants. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that in pregnant women who received probiotics, the risk of preterm birth (< 37 weeks) and miscarriage/stillbirth was no more or less likely compared with those who did not receive probiotics. Only one RCT (159 infants) reported no incidences of early neonatal sepsis (\u2264 3 days) in either trial arm. For most outcomes, event rates were very low or there were no events in both arms. There is a lack of data on neonatal short\u2010term (early or late sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, neonatal death, hospital stay) and long\u2010term (major neurodevelopmental disability) potential benefits or harms following probiotic administration. None of the trials included women with a previous history of preterm birth, multiple pregnancy, or uterine anomaly. Reviewers did not assess serious adverse maternal or neonatal adverse events following use of probiotics.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "RCT (rct): A study which tests the effectiveness and safety of treatments or procedures as fairly and objectively as possible. By randomly assigning patients to different treatments for the same problem, the results can be assessed equally with the aim of discovering the best possible procedure for the condition.\nPLACEBO (placebo): an inactive substance; a pill/liquid that contains no medicine\nMORBIDITY (morbidity): undesired result or complication\nMORTALITY (mortality): death\nRISK (risk): The chance that an activity or hazard will give rise to harm. Risk is generally given in terms of numerical odds (1 in 10) or percentages (10%).\nSEPSIS (sepsis): The immune system's overreaction to an infection or injury which can lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and death.\nPOTENTIAL (potential): possible\nPOTENTIATE (potentiate): increase or multiply the effect of a drug or toxin (poison) by giving another drug or toxin at the same time (sometimes an unintentional result)\nPOTENTIATOR (potentiator): an agent that helps another agent work better\nASSESS (assess): to learn about, measure, evaluate, look at",

            "llm_answer": "Yes, probiotics administered to pregnant women have been shown to help prevent morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that can help maintain a healthy gut microbiome, which is important for the development and function of various bodily systems, including the immune system.\nStudies have found that probiotics can help reduce the risk of preterm birth, which is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Probiotics have also been shown to reduce the risk of other complications in preterm infants, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious condition that can cause damage to the intestines.\nIt's important to note that not all probiotics are the same, and some strains have been found to be more effective than others in preventing morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. For example, the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any supplements during pregnancy, including probiotics, to ensure safety and effectiveness. Additionally, it's important to note that while probiotics can help reduce the risk of complications, they are not a guarantee against them, and other factors such as proper prenatal care, a healthy diet, and a safe delivery are also important for a healthy pregnancy and baby.",
