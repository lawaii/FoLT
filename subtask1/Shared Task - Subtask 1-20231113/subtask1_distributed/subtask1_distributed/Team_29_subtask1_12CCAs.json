            "gold_answer": "Intermittent fasting, compared with usual diet or an energy restriction diet, did not appear to provide clinically meaningful reduction in body weight, blood glucose, or total body cholesterol levels. Reviewers found no RCT evidence assessing effects of intermittent fasting on all\u2010cause mortality nor on major adverse cardiovascular events. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that intermittent fasting compared with usual diet (ad libitum feeding) does not result in a clinically meaningful reduction (at least 5%) in weight within a short\u2010term follow\u2010up period of up to three months (mean difference around \u20102.9 kg weight loss). Very low\u2010certainty evidence suggests little to no difference between intermittent fasting and usual diet in absolute change in blood glucose (mean difference around \u20100.03 mmol/L) over a short\u2010term follow\u2010up period of three months. Total cholesterol levels were lower with intermittent fasting than with usual diet, but evidence is uncertain. Results on blood pressure were mixed. Very low\u2010certainty evidence suggests no clinically meaningful reduction in absolute body weight (mean difference around \u20100.9 kg) nor absolute change in glucose levels (mean difference around 0.02 mmol/L) when intermittent fasting is compared with an energy restriction diet during a short\u2010term follow up period of up to three months. Evidence on effects of intermittent fasting compared with an energy restriction diet on total cholesterol over the same time period was uncertain. When looking at medium\u2010term follow\u2010up (3 to 12 months), reviewers found little to no difference between groups for absolute body weight reduction (mean difference around \u20100.6 kg) nor for absolute change in glucose (mean difference around 0.01 mmol/L). Again, evidence on total body cholesterol was uncertain. Little to no difference was reported for blood pressure at short\u2010 or medium\u2010term follow\u2010up. Reviewers found no trials assessing effects of intermittent fasting on hard endpoints such as all\u2010cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, stroke, myocardial infarction, or heart failure. Quality of life was assessed only for intermittent fasting compared with energy restriction; results were uncertain.",

It includes LDL, or low-density lipoprotein, which is \u2018bad\u2019 cholesterol; HDL, or high-density lipoprotein, which is \u2018good\u2019 cholesterol; and triglycerides (TG). A high level of cholesterol in the blood is a major risk factor for heart attack and indirectly increases your risk of stroke.\nRCT (rct): A study which tests the effectiveness and safety of treatments or procedures as fairly and objectively as possible. By randomly assigning patients to different treatments for the same problem, the results can be assessed equally with the aim of discovering the best possible procedure for the condition.\nASSESS (assess): to learn about, measure, evaluate, look at\nMORTALITY (mortality): death\nPERIOD (period): A bleed from the vagina between every 3 to 5 weeks which forms part of the menstrual cycle (see menstrual cycle).\nMYOCARDIAL (myocardial): pertaining to the heart muscle\nINFARCT (infarct): death of tissue due to lack of blood supply",

            "llm_answer": "Intermittent fasting (IF) has gained popularity as a potential strategy for preventing cardiovascular disease (CVD) in adults. While IF has been shown to have beneficial effects on various CVD risk factors, its comparative effectiveness versus ad libitum (AL) and continuous energy restriction (CER) dietary styles remains unclear.\nA 2020 systematic review and meta-analysis of 18 studies found that IF resulted in similar weight loss and improvements in blood pressure, triglycerides, and HDL-C compared to CER. However, IF was associated with greater improvements in LDL-C and apolipoprotein A-1, and lower reductions in HDL-C and apolipoprotein B, compared to CER.\nA 2022 Cochrane Review of 13 randomized controlled trials found that IF resulted in significant weight loss and improvements in blood pressure, triglycerides, and HDL-C, but the evidence for LDL-C and apolipoprotein A-1 was limited and inconsistent. The review noted that the majority of studies had short follow-up periods, and the quality of the evidence was generally low.\nA 2020 meta-analysis of 24 studies found that both IF and CER were associated with significant reductions in CVD risk factors, but the between-group differences were not statistically significant.\nIn summary, the evidence suggests that IF may have similar or potentially greater benefits compared to AL and CER for preventing CVD in adults, particularly in regards to LDL-C and apolipoprotein A-1. However, the quality of the evidence is generally low, and further research is needed to determine the long-term effects of IF on CVD outcomes. It is important to note that IF may not be suitable or sustainable for everyone, and individual preferences and health status should be taken into account when choosing a dietary style.",

            "gold_answer": "Intermittent fasting, compared with usual diet or an energy restriction diet, did not appear to provide clinically meaningful reduction in body weight, blood glucose, or total body cholesterol levels. Reviewers found no RCT evidence assessing effects of intermittent fasting on all\u2010cause mortality nor on major adverse cardiovascular events. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that intermittent fasting compared with usual diet (ad libitum feeding) does not result in a clinically meaningful reduction (at least 5%) in weight within a short\u2010term follow\u2010up period of up to three months (mean difference around \u20102.9 kg weight loss). Very low\u2010certainty evidence suggests little to no difference between intermittent fasting and usual diet in absolute change in blood glucose (mean difference around \u20100.03 mmol/L) over a short\u2010term follow\u2010up period of three months. Total cholesterol levels were lower with intermittent fasting than with usual diet, but evidence is uncertain. Results on blood pressure were mixed. Very low\u2010certainty evidence suggests no clinically meaningful reduction in absolute body weight (mean difference around \u20100.9 kg) nor absolute change in glucose levels (mean difference around 0.02 mmol/L) when intermittent fasting is compared with an energy restriction diet during a short\u2010term follow up period of up to three months. Evidence on effects of intermittent fasting compared with an energy restriction diet on total cholesterol over the same time period was uncertain. When looking at medium\u2010term follow\u2010up (3 to 12 months), reviewers found little to no difference between groups for absolute body weight reduction (mean difference around \u20100.6 kg) nor for absolute change in glucose (mean difference around 0.01 mmol/L). Again, evidence on total body cholesterol was uncertain. Little to no difference was reported for blood pressure at short\u2010 or medium\u2010term follow\u2010up. Reviewers found no trials assessing effects of intermittent fasting on hard endpoints such as all\u2010cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, stroke, myocardial infarction, or heart failure. Quality of life was assessed only for intermittent fasting compared with energy restriction; results were uncertain.",

            "llm_answer": "Intermittent fasting, ad libitum, and continuous energy restriction are three different dietary styles that have been studied for their potential effects on cardiovascular disease prevention in adults.\nIntermittent fasting involves alternating periods of eating and fasting in order to restrict overall calorie intake. Some studies have shown that intermittent fasting can lead to weight loss, improvements in insulin sensitivity, and reductions in inflammation, all of which can help reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. However, it is important to note that the scientific evidence for intermittent fasting is still limited and more research is needed to fully understand its effects on cardiovascular health.\nAd libitum, on the other hand, refers to a diet in which individuals are allowed to eat as much or as little as they like, without any restrictions on portion sizes or calorie intake. While this approach may be more convenient and easier to follow for some people, it can also lead to overeating and weight gain, which can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.\nContinuous energy restriction, as the name suggests, involves continuously restricting calorie intake over a period of time. This approach has been shown to be effective for weight loss and improving cardiovascular risk factors, such as reducing blood pressure and triglycerides. However, it can also be challenging to maintain in the long-term, and may lead to nutrient deficiencies if not properly planned.\nIn summary, while all three dietary styles have their own advantages and disadvantages, continuous energy restriction and intermittent fasting may be more effective for preventing cardiovascular disease compared to ad libitum, due to their ability to promote weight loss and improve metabolic health. However, it's important to note that the best dietary approach will vary depending on individual needs and preferences, and it's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian before making significant changes to your diet.",

Vitamin D may result in little to no difference in weight\u2010for\u2010age (low\u2010certainty evidence).

These include:\n1. Increased bone mineral density: Vitamin D supplementation has been shown to increase bone mineral density in infants and children, which can help prevent bone-related disorders such as rickets and osteomalacia.\n2. Improved linear growth: Vitamin D supplementation has been linked to improved linear growth in infants and children, as measured by increased height and weight gain.\n3. Reduced risk of vitamin D deficiency: Vitamin D supplementation can help prevent vitamin D deficiency, which is common in young children, especially those who are breastfed or have limited sun exposure.\n4. Reduced risk of infections: Vitamin D supplementation has been shown to reduce the risk of infections, such as respiratory and gastrointestinal infections, in infants and children.\n5. Reduced risk of autoimmune diseases: Some studies suggest that vitamin D supplementation may reduce the risk of developing autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis, although more research is needed to confirm these findings.\nIt's important to note that the benefits of vitamin D supplementation may vary depending on the dosage and duration of supplementation, as well as the individual child's health status and other factors. It's always best to consult with a healthcare provider to determine the appropriate dosage and duration of vitamin D supplementation for a specific child.",

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers evaluated the accuracy of the Xpert\u00ae MTB/RIF assay for detecting extrapulmonary TB using cerebrospinal fluid, pleural fluid, lymph node aspirate, or urine specimens and culture\u2010based susceptibility testing (solid or liquid culture) as the reference standard. Specificity was high for all four specimen/TB types (\u2265 96%; all results on average); at a prevalence of 10%, the number of people wrongly diagnosed would range from 10 (pleural TB) to 37 (lymph node TB) for every 1000 people tested. Sensitivity was more variable, with estimates of 85.9% for genitourinary TB, 81.6% for lymph node TB, 71.1% for TB meningitis, and 49.5% for pleural TB. These estimates suggest that the number of people missed at 10% prevalence would range from 14 (genitourinary TB) to 50 (pleural TB) for every 1000 people tested. From a pretest probability of 10%, the probability of TB increases to between approx. 75% (TB meningitis) to 83% (genitourinary and pleural TB) after a positive test and decreases to between approx. 1.5% (genitourinary TB) to 5% (pleural TB) after a negative test.",

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers evaluated the accuracy of the Xpert\u00ae MTB/RIF assay for detecting extrapulmonary TB using cerebrospinal fluid, pleural fluid, lymph node aspirate, or urine specimens and culture\u2010based susceptibility testing (solid or liquid culture) as the reference standard. Specificity was high for all four specimen/TB types (\u2265 96%; all results on average); at a prevalence of 10%, the number of people wrongly diagnosed would range from 10 (pleural TB) to 37 (lymph node TB) for every 1000 people tested. Sensitivity was more variable, with estimates of 85.9% for genitourinary TB, 81.6% for lymph node TB, 71.1% for TB meningitis, and 49.5% for pleural TB. These estimates suggest that the number of people missed at 10% prevalence would range from 14 (genitourinary TB) to 50 (pleural TB) for every 1000 people tested. From a pretest probability of 10%, the probability of TB increases to between approx. 75% (TB meningitis) to 83% (genitourinary and pleural TB) after a positive test and decreases to between approx. 1.5% (genitourinary TB) to 5% (pleural TB) after a negative test.",

            "gold_answer": "People with PTSD probably have better treatment response with SSRIs than with placebo, and may have some symptomatic relief and experience no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events. Venlafaxine may also lead to some symptomatic relief when compared with placebo. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that compared with placebo for people with PTSD, there were probably fewer non\u2010responders to SSRIs (245 vs 371 per 1000 people; all results on average), with minimal to no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events. SSRIs may reduce clinician\u2010reported PTSD symptoms (based on 2615 participants); slightly reduce the change score of depressive symptoms (1551 participants); and slightly reduce functional disability (1336 participants), with minimal to no important difference in self\u2010rated scales of PTSD symptoms, final score of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and withdrawals due to any cause. Compared with placebo, venlafaxine may reduce clinician\u2010reported PTSD symptoms (based on 687 participants) and the change score of depressive symptoms, and may slightly reduce self\u2010rated scales of PTSD symptoms (358 participants) and functional disability (687 participants), with minimal to no important difference in the final score of depressive symptoms and withdrawals due to adverse events or for any cause (329 to 687 participants).",

It's important to work closely with a healthcare provider to determine the best course of treatment and to monitor for any potential side effects. Additionally, these medications are often used in conjunction with therapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to maximize their effectiveness.",

Venlafaxine may also lead to some symptomatic relief when compared with placebo. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that compared with placebo for people with PTSD, there were probably fewer non\u2010responders to SSRIs (245 vs 371 per 1000 people; all results on average), with minimal to no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events. SSRIs may reduce clinician\u2010reported PTSD symptoms (based on 2615 participants); slightly reduce the change score of depressive symptoms (1551 participants); and slightly reduce functional disability (1336 participants), with minimal to no important difference in self\u2010rated scales of PTSD symptoms, final score of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and withdrawals due to any cause. Compared with placebo, venlafaxine may reduce clinician\u2010reported PTSD symptoms (based on 687 participants) and the change score of depressive symptoms, and may slightly reduce self\u2010rated scales of PTSD symptoms (358 participants) and functional disability (687 participants), with minimal to no important difference in the final score of depressive symptoms and withdrawals due to adverse events or for any cause (329 to 687 participants).",

Evidence for other outcomes for both comparisons was of low certainty, suggesting little to no difference between groups (endometrial thickness), of very low certainty (live birth, miscarriage, clinical pregnancy for programmed vs stimulated cycle), or absent (cycle cancellation for programmed vs stimulated cycle, adverse effects).",

Evidence for other outcomes for both comparisons was of low certainty, suggesting little to no difference between groups (endometrial thickness), of very low certainty (live birth, miscarriage, clinical pregnancy for programmed vs stimulated cycle), or absent (cycle cancellation for programmed vs stimulated cycle, adverse effects).",

            "llm_answer": "A programmed cycle, also known as a frozen embryo transfer (FET) cycle, is a type of IVF cycle where a frozen embryo is thawed and transferred to the uterus. In contrast, a stimulated cycle, also known as a fresh embryo transfer cycle, involves the transfer of embryos that are freshly fertilized and have developed in the lab for 3-5 days. A natural cycle, on the other hand, refers to a pregnancy that occurs naturally, without any medical intervention.\nIn terms of success rates, programmed cycles have been shown to have higher success rates compared to stimulated cycles, especially for women over 35 years old. This is because frozen embryos have a higher implantation rate than fresh embryos, possibly due to the fact that they have had time to develop and mature before being transferred. Additionally, programmed cycles allow for a more controlled and optimized environment for the embryo to implant, as the uterus is prepared with hormonal medication before the transfer.\nHowever, it's important to note that programmed cycles require a frozen embryo, which may not be available or suitable for all patients. Stimulated cycles, on the other hand, can be done with either fresh or frozen embryos, and are often preferred for patients who have a high number of good-quality embryos.\nIn summary, programmed cycles have higher success rates compared to stimulated cycles, especially for women over 35, but require a frozen embryo. Stimulated cycles offer more flexibility and can be done with fresh or frozen embryos, but may have lower success rates compared to programmed cycles. It's important to discuss the best option for your individual circumstances with your fertility specialist.",

            "question": "For adults with decompensated liver cirrhosis, how do interventions to treat acute bleeding esophageal varices compare?",
            "gold_answer": "For adults with decompensated liver cirrhosis and bleeding esophageal varices, moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that sclerotherapy, sclerotherapy/somatostatin analogs, and somatostatin analogs/variceal band ligation (VBL) probably have lower mortality rates than balloon tamponade, somatostatin analogs, or vasopressin analogs. The two combination treatments also probably have lower mortality than balloon tamponade/sclerotherapy. Only the analysis for mortality included all 18 active treatment options, and results for most pairwise comparisons were too imprecise to suggest the presence or absence of an effect. Reviewers performed network meta\u2010analyses (NMAs) comparing 18 active treatment options (sclerotherapy; somatostatin analogs; vasopressin analogs; VBL; balloon tamponade; portocaval shunt; sclerotherapy plus balloon tamponade, somatostatin analogs, VBL, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt [TIPS], or vasopressin analogs; balloon tamponade plus nitrates/vasopressin analogs, somatostatin analogs, vasopressin analogs, or VBL; VBL plus somatostatin analogs or vasopressin analogs; nitrates plus vasopressin analogs) for treatment of bleeding esophageal varices in people with decompensated liver cirrhosis. The Cochrane Review included 52 RCTs, with 2 to 45 RCTs included in individual NMAs. Reviewers reported absolute values per 1000 people for five treatment options (somatostatin analogs, vasopressin analogs, sclerotherapy/somatostatin analogs, VBL, and balloon tamponade) compared with sclerotherapy. The NMA for mortality included all 18 active treatment options. Of the 153 pairwise comparisons, 13 suggest benefit of one active intervention over another; results for other pairwise comparisons were too imprecise to suggest the presence or absence of an effect. Sclerotherapy alone or with somatostatin analogs, and somatostatin analogs plus VBL, seemed to perform better than balloon tamponade, somatostatin analogs, and vasopressin analogs. Sclerotherapy/somatostatin analogs and somatostatin analogs/VBL also seemed to perform better than balloon tamponade/sclerotherapy. Thirteen active treatment options were compared in the NMA of any variceal bleed (beta blockers/sclerotherapy and portocaval shunt omitted). Of the 78 pairwise comparisons, 14 suggest benefit of one active intervention over another; VBL alone or in combination with vasopressin or somatostatin analogs, and sclerotherapy in combination with balloon tamponade or somatostatin analogs, seemed to perform better than balloon tamponade alone or in combination with vasopressin analogs. For these two outcomes, reviewers rated evidence as moderate certainty when a difference between pairs of active treatment was detected, and as low or very low certainty for less precise results. Reviewers performed two NMAs (mortality and any variceal bleed) that included only trials published in 2000 or later, thereby including only active treatments more commonly used in current clinical practice; results for all pairwise comparisons in these two NMAs were too imprecise to suggest the presence or absence of an effect. The NMA for volume of red blood cells or whole blood transfused included 14 active interventions; however, reviewers stated that inconsistency in the NMA made the validity of the results uncertain; RCTs making direct comparisons included 30 to 324 participants (19 of 28 had fewer than 100 participants). NMAs for symptomatic variceal rebleed, other features of decompensation, additional treatment to control variceal bleeding, length of hospital stay, and serious adverse events included between three and ten active treatments; when assessed, reviewers rated the evidence for these outcomes as very low certainty.",

Of the 153 pairwise comparisons, 13 suggest benefit of one active intervention over another; results for other pairwise comparisons were too imprecise to suggest the presence or absence of an effect. Sclerotherapy alone or with somatostatin analogs, and somatostatin analogs plus VBL, seemed to perform better than balloon tamponade, somatostatin analogs, and vasopressin analogs. Sclerotherapy/somatostatin analogs and somatostatin analogs/VBL also seemed to perform better than balloon tamponade/sclerotherapy. Thirteen active treatment options were compared in the NMA of any variceal bleed (beta blockers/sclerotherapy and portocaval shunt omitted). Of the 78 pairwise comparisons, 14 suggest benefit of one active intervention over another; VBL alone or in combination with vasopressin or somatostatin analogs, and sclerotherapy in combination with balloon tamponade or somatostatin analogs, seemed to perform better than balloon tamponade alone or in combination with vasopressin analogs. For these two outcomes, reviewers rated evidence as moderate certainty when a difference between pairs of active treatment was detected, and as low or very low certainty for less precise results. Reviewers performed two NMAs (mortality and any variceal bleed) that included only trials published in 2000 or later, thereby including only active treatments more commonly used in current clinical practice; results for all pairwise comparisons in these two NMAs were too imprecise to suggest the presence or absence of an effect. The NMA for volume of red blood cells or whole blood transfused included 14 active interventions; however, reviewers stated that inconsistency in the NMA made the validity of the results uncertain; RCTs making direct comparisons included 30 to 324 participants (19 of 28 had fewer than 100 participants). NMAs for symptomatic variceal rebleed, other features of decompensation, additional treatment to control variceal bleeding, length of hospital stay, and serious adverse events included between three and ten active treatments; when assessed, reviewers rated the evidence for these outcomes as very low certainty.",

            "llm_answer": "Interventions to treat acute bleeding esophageal varices in adults with decompensated liver cirrhosis are typically compared based on their efficacy, safety, and tolerability. The main interventions used to treat acute bleeding esophageal varices include:\n1. Endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL): This is a minimally invasive procedure that uses an endoscope to ligate (tie off) the varices. EVL has been shown to have a high success rate in controlling bleeding and reducing the risk of rebleeding.\n2. Sclerotherapy: This involves injecting a solution into the varices to cause them to scar and shrink. Sclerotherapy has been shown to be effective in controlling bleeding, but it may require multiple sessions and has a higher risk of rebleeding compared to EVL.\n3. Balloon tamponade: This involves using a balloon to compress the varices and stop bleeding. Balloon tamponade is a temporary measure and may need to be repeated multiple times.\n4. Pharmacological interventions: Medications such as beta blockers, nitrates, and antacids may be used to help reduce bleeding and prevent rebleeding.\nIt's important to note that the choice of intervention depends on various factors, including the severity of bleeding, the patient's overall health, and the presence of other complications. Your healthcare provider will be able to discuss the best treatment options with you and make recommendations based on your individual situation.\nIt's important to note that these interventions are not mutually exclusive, and a combination of them may be used in some cases. Additionally, the best approach may vary depending on the specific cause of the bleeding and the patient's individual circumstances. It's important to discuss the best course of treatment with a qualified healthcare professional.",

            "gold_answer": "High\u2010quality evidence shows that children and adults with a clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) meningitis receiving an anti\u2010TB regimen are less likely to die within 24 months when an adjunctive corticosteroid is administered (312 versus 413 per 1000 people died with an adjunctive corticosteroid compared with no corticosteroid, respectively). Moderate\u2010quality evidence showed that this benefit was not sustained in the longer\u2010term (5 years). Low\u2010quality evidence suggests there was no benefit of an adjunctive corticosteroid in terms of reducing rates of disabling neurological deficit, ether within 24 months or at 5 years. There was no apparent impact of adjunctive corticosteroids on the incidences of hepatitis, hyperglycemia/glycosuria, gastrointestinal bleeding, or invasive bacterial infection but event rates were very low meaning conclusions cannot be drawn.",

Studies have consistently demonstrated that corticosteroids reduce the risk of death and disability in patients with tuberculous meningitis, particularly in those with severe disease. The use of corticosteroids has been associated with a significant reduction in mortality rates, from approximately 30-40% in untreated patients to around 10-20% in patients receiving corticosteroids. Additionally, corticosteroids have been shown to reduce the risk of long-term disability, such as hearing loss and cognitive impairment. However, the optimal dosage and duration of corticosteroid therapy for tuberculous meningitis are still uncertain and require further research.",

Moderate\u2010quality evidence showed that this benefit was not sustained in the longer\u2010term (5 years). Low\u2010quality evidence suggests there was no benefit of an adjunctive corticosteroid in terms of reducing rates of disabling neurological deficit, ether within 24 months or at 5 years. There was no apparent impact of adjunctive corticosteroids on the incidences of hepatitis, hyperglycemia/glycosuria, gastrointestinal bleeding, or invasive bacterial infection but event rates were very low meaning conclusions cannot be drawn.",

Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that in pregnant women who received probiotics, the risk of preterm birth (< 37 weeks) and miscarriage/stillbirth was no more or less likely compared with those who did not receive probiotics. Only one RCT (159 infants) reported no incidences of early neonatal sepsis (\u2264 3 days) in either trial arm. For most outcomes, event rates were very low or there were no events in both arms. There is a lack of data on neonatal short\u2010term (early or late sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, neonatal death, hospital stay) and long\u2010term (major neurodevelopmental disability) potential benefits or harms following probiotic administration.

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers found no conclusive RCT evidence suggesting that administration of probiotics to pregnant women was superior or inferior to placebo in reducing morbidity or mortality in preterm infants. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that in pregnant women who received probiotics, the risk of preterm birth (< 37 weeks) and miscarriage/stillbirth was no more or less likely compared with those who did not receive probiotics. Only one RCT (159 infants) reported no incidences of early neonatal sepsis (\u2264 3 days) in either trial arm. For most outcomes, event rates were very low or there were no events in both arms. There is a lack of data on neonatal short\u2010term (early or late sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, neonatal death, hospital stay) and long\u2010term (major neurodevelopmental disability) potential benefits or harms following probiotic administration. None of the trials included women with a previous history of preterm birth, multiple pregnancy, or uterine anomaly. Reviewers did not assess serious adverse maternal or neonatal adverse events following use of probiotics.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "RCT (rct): A study which tests the effectiveness and safety of treatments or procedures as fairly and objectively as possible. By randomly assigning patients to different treatments for the same problem, the results can be assessed equally with the aim of discovering the best possible procedure for the condition.\nPLACEBO (placebo): an inactive substance; a pill/liquid that contains no medicine\nMORBIDITY (morbidity): undesired result or complication\nMORTALITY (mortality): death\nRISK (risk): The chance that an activity or hazard will give rise to harm. Risk is generally given in terms of numerical odds (1 in 10) or percentages (10%).\nSEPSIS (sepsis): The immune system's overreaction to an infection or injury which can lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and death.\nPOTENTIAL (potential): possible\nPOTENTIATE (potentiate): increase or multiply the effect of a drug or toxin (poison) by giving another drug or toxin at the same time (sometimes an unintentional result)\nPOTENTIATOR (potentiator): an agent that helps another agent work better\nASSESS (assess): to learn about, measure, evaluate, look at",

            "llm_answer": "Yes, probiotics administered to pregnant women have been shown to help prevent morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that can help maintain a healthy gut microbiome, which is important for the development and function of various bodily systems, including the immune system.\nStudies have found that probiotics can help reduce the risk of preterm birth, which is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Probiotics have also been shown to reduce the risk of other complications in preterm infants, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious condition that can cause damage to the intestines.\nIt's important to note that not all probiotics are the same, and some strains have been found to be more effective than others in preventing morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. For example, the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any supplements during pregnancy, including probiotics, to ensure safety and effectiveness. Additionally, it's important to note that while probiotics can help reduce the risk of complications, they are not a guarantee against them, and other factors such as proper prenatal care, a healthy diet, and a safe delivery are also important for a healthy pregnancy and baby.",
