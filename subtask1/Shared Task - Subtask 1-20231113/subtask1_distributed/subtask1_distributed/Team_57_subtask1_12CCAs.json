            "gold_answer": "Preoperative exercise training may have some benefits for adults with lung cancer undergoing lung resection compared with usual care. In adults undergoing surgical resection for lung cancer, high\u2010 to moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that preoperative exercise training (aerobic exercise and other types of exercise at different frequency, intensity, and duration) results in fewer postoperative pulmonary complications (on average, 159 vs 353 per 1000 people) and shorter hospital stay of around two days. Moderate\u2010 to very low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that exercise training also results in higher exercise capacity (postintervention), as well as greater lung function, as measured using forced expiratory volume in 1 second and forced vital capacity (around 5.9% and 5.4% predicted, respectively). Duration of intercostal catheter use after surgery was shorter with exercise by an average of two days; however, the results did not reach statistical significance. Reviewers noted no adverse effects in either treatment group that were attributable to the intervention. There was little to no difference between groups in postintervention dyspnea or postoperative mortality. It should be noted that the sample sizes of most trials were very small (19 to 151 participants), hence requiring caution in the interpretation of results.",

            "gold_answer": "Preoperative exercise training may have some benefits for adults with lung cancer undergoing lung resection compared with usual care. In adults undergoing surgical resection for lung cancer, high\u2010 to moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that preoperative exercise training (aerobic exercise and other types of exercise at different frequency, intensity, and duration) results in fewer postoperative pulmonary complications (on average, 159 vs 353 per 1000 people) and shorter hospital stay of around two days. Moderate\u2010 to very low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that exercise training also results in higher exercise capacity (postintervention), as well as greater lung function, as measured using forced expiratory volume in 1 second and forced vital capacity (around 5.9% and 5.4% predicted, respectively). Duration of intercostal catheter use after surgery was shorter with exercise by an average of two days; however, the results did not reach statistical significance. Reviewers noted no adverse effects in either treatment group that were attributable to the intervention. There was little to no difference between groups in postintervention dyspnea or postoperative mortality. It should be noted that the sample sizes of most trials were very small (19 to 151 participants), hence requiring caution in the interpretation of results.",

Increased muscle strength: Exercise training can help improve muscle strength, which can make it easier to recover from surgery and reduce the risk of complications such as respiratory failure.\n3. Better lung function: Exercise training can help improve lung function, which can make it easier to breathe and reduce the risk of respiratory complications during surgery.\n4. Reduced risk of complications: Exercise training can help reduce the risk of complications during surgery, such as wound infections and respiratory failure.\n5. Faster recovery: Exercise training can help improve recovery after surgery, reducing the time spent in the hospital and improving overall quality of life.\nHowever, there are also potential harms associated with preoperative exercise training for people with NSCLC. These harms include:\nHarms:\n1. Overexertion: Exercise training can be harmful if the patient overexerts themselves, leading to fatigue, muscle strain, or other injuries.\n2. Cardiac complications: Exercise training can increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as heart attacks or arrhythmias, in people with pre-existing heart conditions.\n3. Respiratory complications: Exercise training can increase the risk of respiratory complications, such as respiratory failure or pneumonia, in people with pre-existing respiratory conditions.\n4. Muscle damage: Exercise training can cause muscle damage, particularly if the patient has pre-existing muscle weakness or muscle damage.\n5.

Compared with placebo, lulizumab SC 1.25 to 12.5 mg weekly or every other week for 6 months led to inconclusive results for skin\u2010specific measures of SLE disease activity and imprecise results for severe adverse events. Comparisons of epratuzumab, sifalimumab, sirukumab, ustekinumab, and anifrolumab versus placebo were evaluated in too few participants to yield reliable results.",

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers identified 18 modeling and observational studies that assessed the impact on the spread of COVID\u201019 of quarantine of travelers alone or in combination with entry and/or exit screening during or after quarantine. These studies provided low\u2010 to very low\u2010certainty evidence suggesting that quarantine alone may reduce the risk/probability of releasing an infected individual into the community (by 0% to 85%), the number of days travelers remain at risk of transmitting the infection into the community upon release (by 0.1 to 2.1 days), the proportion of imported cases (by 55% after a 7\u2010day quarantine, and by 91% after a 14\u2010day quarantine), the number/proportion of cases in the community (by 450 to 64,028 cases), and the number/proportion of cases seeded by imported cases (by 26% to 100%), and may increase case detection (to 51% after a 7\u2010day quarantine, and to 78% after a 14\u2010day quarantine) and delay the peak in active cases and deaths (by 3.5 and 5.5 days, when effectiveness was assumed to be 80% and 90%, respectively). When screening was added to quarantine, evidence suggests the risk/probability of releasing an infected individual into the community may be reduced by 2% to 48%, the days a traveler is at risk of transmitting the infection into the community upon release may be reduced by 0.01 to 2.0 days, case detection may be increased by 41% to 99%, and delay to outbreak may be delayed by 3.5 to 34.1 years depending on the combination of measures.",

            "llm_answer": "Quarantining travelers crossing international borders can help slow the spread of COVID-19, but it is not a foolproof measure. The effectiveness of quarantine in preventing the spread of COVID-19 depends on several factors, including the duration of quarantine, the level of compliance, and the effectiveness of screening measures.\nStudies have shown that quarantine can significantly reduce the spread of COVID-19, particularly when combined with other measures such as testing, contact tracing, and isolation of infected individuals. However, quarantine alone may not be sufficient to completely stop the spread of the virus, especially in cases where infected individuals are not symptomatic or where there are lapses in compliance.\nMoreover, quarantine can have significant social and economic impacts, including disruptions to supply chains, loss of productivity, and increased isolation and stigma for quarantined individuals.\nTherefore, while quarantining travelers crossing international borders can be a useful tool in slowing the spread of COVID-19, it should be used in conjunction with other measures and tailored to the specific circumstances of each situation. It is also important to consider the ethical and legal implications of quarantine and to ensure that the rights and well-being of quarantined individuals are protected.",

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers identified 18 modeling and observational studies that assessed the impact on the spread of COVID\u201019 of quarantine of travelers alone or in combination with entry and/or exit screening during or after quarantine. These studies provided low\u2010 to very low\u2010certainty evidence suggesting that quarantine alone may reduce the risk/probability of releasing an infected individual into the community (by 0% to 85%), the number of days travelers remain at risk of transmitting the infection into the community upon release (by 0.1 to 2.1 days), the proportion of imported cases (by 55% after a 7\u2010day quarantine, and by 91% after a 14\u2010day quarantine), the number/proportion of cases in the community (by 450 to 64,028 cases), and the number/proportion of cases seeded by imported cases (by 26% to 100%), and may increase case detection (to 51% after a 7\u2010day quarantine, and to 78% after a 14\u2010day quarantine) and delay the peak in active cases and deaths (by 3.5 and 5.5 days, when effectiveness was assumed to be 80% and 90%, respectively). When screening was added to quarantine, evidence suggests the risk/probability of releasing an infected individual into the community may be reduced by 2% to 48%, the days a traveler is at risk of transmitting the infection into the community upon release may be reduced by 0.01 to 2.0 days, case detection may be increased by 41% to 99%, and delay to outbreak may be delayed by 3.5 to 34.1 years depending on the combination of measures.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "ASSESS (assess): to learn about, measure, evaluate, look at\nSCREENING (screening): A test or set of tests to check for a condition in a person who shows no symptoms, but who may be at risk (perhaps because of their age or sexual behaviour, for example).\nRISK (risk): The chance that an activity or hazard will give rise to harm. Risk is generally given in terms of numerical odds (1 in 10) or percentages (10%).",

            "llm_answer": "Quarantining travelers crossing international borders can have several effects on the spread of COVID-19, both positive and negative.\nPositive effects:\n1. Reduced transmission risk: Quarantining travelers can help reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19 by separating infected individuals from others who may be susceptible to the virus. This can help slow down the spread of the virus, particularly in areas with high infection rates.\n2. Time for testing and contact tracing: Quarantine periods can provide time for health authorities to test travelers for COVID-19 and conduct contact tracing to identify individuals who may have been in close contact with infected travelers.\n3. Reduced spread through international travel: Quarantining travelers can help reduce the spread of COVID-19 through international travel, as infected individuals are less likely to travel while they are in quarantine.\nNegative effects:\n1. Economic impact: Quarantining travelers can have significant economic impacts, particularly on industries that rely heavily on international travel, such as tourism and trade.\n2. Social distancing challenges: Quarantine measures can create challenges for social distancing, as people may be forced to gather in close proximities while waiting for their quarantine period to end.\n3. Stigma and discrimination: Quarantine measures can also lead to stigma and discrimination against individuals who have been quarantined, which can have negative effects on their mental health and well-being.\n4. Difficulty in enforcement: Quarantine measures can be difficult to enforce, particularly in areas with limited resources or where there is a lack of political will to enforce them.\nIt's important to note that the effectiveness of quarantining travelers in preventing the spread of COVID-19 is highly dependent on several factors, including the length of the quarantine period, the level of testing and contact tracing, and the level of cooperation from the public. Additionally, quarantine measures should be implemented in conjunction with other public health measures, such as vaccination, social distancing, and personal protective equipment (PPE) use, to maximize their effectiveness.",

Based on evidence of the same grade, more people receiving FMT achieved endoscopic remission at 8 to 12 weeks (Mayo score \u2264 2 or SCCAI < 3) (109 vs 75 per 1000 people). There was little to no difference between groups in adverse events (such as abdominal pain, nausea, flatulence, bloating, headaches, and dizziness). Results for quality of life and serious adverse events were very uncertain, and any conclusions regarding clinical or endoscopic response were precluded by an insufficient number of participants in the analyses.",

Studies have consistently demonstrated that FMT can induce remission in patients with active ulcerative colitis, with response rates ranging from 50% to 90%. Additionally, FMT has been shown to improve quality of life, reduce inflammation, and decrease the need for medications such as steroids and immunosuppressants. However, it is important to note that FMT is not a cure for ulcerative colitis, and some patients may require ongoing maintenance therapy to maintain remission. As with any medical treatment, there are potential risks and side effects associated with FMT, including infection and colonoscopy-related complications. It is important to discuss the benefits and risks of FMT with a healthcare provider to determine if it is an appropriate treatment option for an individual patient.",

There was little to no difference between groups in adverse events (such as abdominal pain, nausea, flatulence, bloating, headaches, and dizziness).

Additionally, FMT has been found to be safe and well-tolerated, with minimal side effects.

Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests there is no clear impact of one schedule over the other either on patient\u2010reported signs of eczema or local adverse events at one to six weeks. Evidence for systemic adverse events was of very low certainty. Of note, 90% of the studies were published between 1981 and 1999.",

While they have been shown to reduce exacerbations in patients with asthma, their efficacy in reducing exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults has not been well-studied.\nA systematic review and meta-analysis published in the journal Respiratory Research in 2020 found that mepolizumab and benralizumab were associated with a reduced risk of COPD exacerbations compared to placebo in adult patients with severe COPD. However, the quality of the evidence was generally low, and the authors noted that further research is needed to confirm these findings.\nIt's important to note that both mepolizumab and benralizumab are not approved by the US FDA for the treatment of COPD, and their use for this indication is considered off-label. Additionally, these medications can have potential side effects and risks, so it's important to discuss the benefits and risks with a healthcare provider before initiating treatment.\nIn summary, while there is some evidence suggesting that mepolizumab and benralizumab may be effective in reducing exacerbations of COPD in adults, more research is needed to confirm these findings and to establish their long-term safety and efficacy for this indication.

However, some studies suggest that the following interventions may be beneficial:\n1. Olfactory training: This involves exercises that aim to stimulate the olfactory system and promote neuroplasticity. Studies have shown that olfactory training can improve olfactory function in patients with olfactory dysfunction.\n2. Nasal saline irrigation: This involves rinsing the nasal passages with a saline solution to remove inflammatory mediators and promote nasal cleansing. Some studies suggest that nasal saline irrigation may improve olfactory function in patients with post-COVID-19 olfactory dysfunction.\n3. Antioxidant supplements: Oxidative stress may contribute to olfactory dysfunction. Antioxidant supplements, such as vitamin C and E, may help to reduce oxidative stress and improve olfactory function.\n4. Steroids: Corticosteroids may help to reduce inflammation in the nasal passages and improve olfactory function. However, the long-term effects of steroid use are not well established, and their use should be carefully monitored.\n5. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy: PRP therapy involves injecting platelet-rich plasma into the nasal passages to stimulate healing and regeneration of the olfactory epithelium. Some studies suggest that PRP therapy may improve olfactory function in patients with post-COVID-19 olfactory dysfunction.\nIt is important to note that these interventions are not universally effective and may have varying degrees of success in different individuals. Further research is needed to fully understand the effects of these interventions and to identify the most effective treatments for persistent post-COVID-19 olfactory dysfunction.",

The term \"persistent post-COVID-19 olfactory dysfunction\" is not a recognized medical condition, and it is not clear what specific interventions are being referred to.\nIf you meant to ask about the effects of different interventions for the prevention of long-term olfactory dysfunction caused by COVID-19, there is currently limited research on this topic. The best way to prevent olfactory dysfunction caused by COVID-19 is to take steps to prevent the spread of the virus, such as washing your hands frequently, wearing a mask, and practicing social distancing.\nIf you have already experienced olfactory dysfunction due to COVID-19, there are some potential treatments being studied, such as olfactory training exercises, nasal saline irrigation, and steroid nasal sprays. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before trying any treatments to ensure they are safe and appropriate for your individual case.\nAgain, I apologize for any confusion caused by my response, and I hope this information is helpful.

Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows a likely shorter duration of ICU stay with early initiation (by one day; all results on average). High\u2010certainty evidence shows that risk of hypophosphatemia, hypotension, and cardiac\u2010rhythm disorder is higher with early initiation than with standard initiation (with a difference of 34, 31, and 5 per 1000 people, respectively), despite that results for any adverse events were very uncertain.",

Waste products are then excreted as urine.\nDISEASE (disease): An abnormal condition in the body causing harm.\nSTAGING (staging): an evaluation of the extent of the disease\nMORTALITY (mortality): death\nRISK (risk): The chance that an activity or hazard will give rise to harm. Risk is generally given in terms of numerical odds (1 in 10) or percentages (10%).\nHYPOTENSION (hypotension): low blood pressure",

            "llm_answer": "Early initiation of kidney replacement therapy (KRT) in people with acute kidney injury (AKI) has been shown to improve survival and reduce the risk of complications compared to standard initiation. Early initiation is typically defined as starting KRT within 24-48 hours of AKI diagnosis, while standard initiation is typically defined as starting KRT after 48-72 hours. Studies have shown that early initiation of KRT is associated with lower mortality rates, shorter hospital stays, and reduced need for mechanical ventilation and dialysis. However, early initiation may also be associated with higher rates of renal recovery and discontinuation of KRT. The optimal timing of KRT initiation in AKI remains a topic of debate and should be individualized based on patient factors and clinical context.",

            "gold_answer": "For adults admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with acute kidney injury and compared with standard initiation of KRT, low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that early initiation of KRT (within 6 to 12 hours of documentation of Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes [KDIGO] stage 2 to 3) does not seem to affect mortality or the composite outcome of death or non\u2010recovery of kidney function. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows a likely shorter duration of ICU stay with early initiation (by one day; all results on average). High\u2010certainty evidence shows that risk of hypophosphatemia, hypotension, and cardiac\u2010rhythm disorder is higher with early initiation than with standard initiation (with a difference of 34, 31, and 5 per 1000 people, respectively), despite that results for any adverse events were very uncertain.",

This is because AKI can lead to a buildup of toxins in the body, which can cause further damage to the kidneys and other organs if left untreated. Early initiation of KRT can help to remove these toxins and prevent further damage.\nIn contrast, standard initiation of KRT, which is typically defined as starting dialysis after 48-72 hours of AKI diagnosis, may lead to a higher risk of complications and longer hospital stays. This is because the delay in starting dialysis can allow toxins to build up in the body, leading to further damage and increased risk of complications.\nIt's important to note that the optimal timing of KRT initiation may vary depending on the individual patient and the severity of their AKI. It's important for healthcare providers to carefully assess each patient and determine the most appropriate timing for KRT initiation based on their individual needs.\nIn summary, early initiation of KRT for people with AKI has been shown to have several benefits compared to standard initiation, including improved survival, reduced risk of complications, and shorter hospital stays.

            "gold_answer": "Exercise\u2010based cardiac rehabilitation programs seem to reduce fatal and/or nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), cardiovascular mortality, and hospital admissions and improve quality of life over standard medical care for lower\u2010risk patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). High\u2010certainty evidence shows that fewer people had fatal and/or nonfatal MI with exercise than with usual care at 6 to 12 months (29 vs 40 per 1000 people; all results on average), and moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that exercise\u2010based rehabilitation may slightly reduce all\u2010cause mortality at 6 to 12 months (45 vs 52 per 1000 people), although the difference between groups did not reach statistical significance. Cardiovascular mortality appears to be reduced by exercise at > 12 months to 36 months (106 vs 138 per 1000 people; based on 3614 participants) and at > 3 years (90 vs 156 per 1000 people; based on 1392 participants). In the short term (follow\u2010up of 6 to 12 months), moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows a lower rate of hospital admissions (103 vs 179 per 1000 people), but this does not seem to persist over the longer term. Reviewers reported improvement in health\u2010related quality of life at 6 to 12 months with cardiac rehabilitation but similar rates of patients needing revascularization in both groups. It is worth noting, however, that most studies consisted predominantly of lower\u2010risk young men, which limits generalization of these findings to other groups of patients with CHD, especially women and higher\u2010risk men, including those with angina pectoris or with major comorbidities.",

Moderate\u2010quality evidence showed that this benefit was not sustained in the longer\u2010term (5 years). Low\u2010quality evidence suggests there was no benefit of an adjunctive corticosteroid in terms of reducing rates of disabling neurological deficit, ether within 24 months or at 5 years. There was no apparent impact of adjunctive corticosteroids on the incidences of hepatitis, hyperglycemia/glycosuria, gastrointestinal bleeding, or invasive bacterial infection but event rates were very low meaning conclusions cannot be drawn.",

Studies have consistently demonstrated that corticosteroids reduce the risk of death and disability in patients with tuberculous meningitis, particularly in those with severe disease. The use of corticosteroids has been associated with a significant reduction in mortality rates, from approximately 30-40% in untreated patients to around 10-20% in patients receiving corticosteroids. Additionally, corticosteroids have been shown to reduce the risk of long-term disability, such as hearing loss and cognitive impairment. However, the optimal dosage and duration of corticosteroid therapy for tuberculous meningitis are still uncertain and require further research.",

Moderate\u2010quality evidence showed that this benefit was not sustained in the longer\u2010term (5 years). Low\u2010quality evidence suggests there was no benefit of an adjunctive corticosteroid in terms of reducing rates of disabling neurological deficit, ether within 24 months or at 5 years. There was no apparent impact of adjunctive corticosteroids on the incidences of hepatitis, hyperglycemia/glycosuria, gastrointestinal bleeding, or invasive bacterial infection but event rates were very low meaning conclusions cannot be drawn.",

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers found no conclusive RCT evidence suggesting that administration of probiotics to pregnant women was superior or inferior to placebo in reducing morbidity or mortality in preterm infants. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that in pregnant women who received probiotics, the risk of preterm birth (< 37 weeks) and miscarriage/stillbirth was no more or less likely compared with those who did not receive probiotics. Only one RCT (159 infants) reported no incidences of early neonatal sepsis (\u2264 3 days) in either trial arm. For most outcomes, event rates were very low or there were no events in both arms. There is a lack of data on neonatal short\u2010term (early or late sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, neonatal death, hospital stay) and long\u2010term (major neurodevelopmental disability) potential benefits or harms following probiotic administration. None of the trials included women with a previous history of preterm birth, multiple pregnancy, or uterine anomaly. Reviewers did not assess serious adverse maternal or neonatal adverse events following use of probiotics.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "RCT (rct): A study which tests the effectiveness and safety of treatments or procedures as fairly and objectively as possible. By randomly assigning patients to different treatments for the same problem, the results can be assessed equally with the aim of discovering the best possible procedure for the condition.\nPLACEBO (placebo): an inactive substance; a pill/liquid that contains no medicine\nMORBIDITY (morbidity): undesired result or complication\nMORTALITY (mortality): death\nRISK (risk): The chance that an activity or hazard will give rise to harm. Risk is generally given in terms of numerical odds (1 in 10) or percentages (10%).\nSEPSIS (sepsis): The immune system's overreaction to an infection or injury which can lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and death.\nPOTENTIAL (potential): possible\nPOTENTIATE (potentiate): increase or multiply the effect of a drug or toxin (poison) by giving another drug or toxin at the same time (sometimes an unintentional result)\nPOTENTIATOR (potentiator): an agent that helps another agent work better\nASSESS (assess): to learn about, measure, evaluate, look at",

            "llm_answer": "Yes, probiotics administered to pregnant women have been shown to help prevent morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that can help maintain a healthy gut microbiome, which is important for the development and function of various bodily systems, including the immune system.\nStudies have found that probiotics can help reduce the risk of preterm birth, which is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Probiotics have also been shown to reduce the risk of other complications in preterm infants, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious condition that can cause damage to the intestines.\nIt's important to note that not all probiotics are the same, and some strains have been found to be more effective than others in preventing morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. For example, the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any supplements during pregnancy, including probiotics, to ensure safety and effectiveness. Additionally, it's important to note that while probiotics can help reduce the risk of complications, they are not a guarantee against them, and other factors such as proper prenatal care, a healthy diet, and a safe delivery are also important for a healthy pregnancy and baby.",
