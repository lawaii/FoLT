            "gold_answer": "For infants of diabetic mothers, oral dextrose gel massaged into the buccal mucosa after birth reduces the number of infants developing hypoglycemia (defined as <2.6 mmol/L) compared with placebo (on average, 366 vs 421 per 1000 infants; high\u2010certainty evidence), which might lead to a reduction in the need for treatment for hypoglycemia. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that fewer infants had a major neurological disability at two years of age or older with dextrose gel (on average, 12 vs 60 per 1000 infants). Evidence suggests that oral dextrose gel probably has little to no effect on separation from the mother or admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for treatment of hypoglycemia (low\u2010certainty evidence) or on breastfeeding after discharge (based on 2323 infants). Researchers observed adverse events and neonatal seizures in less than 0.5% of infants in both groups.",

            "gold_answer": "For women with singleton pregnancies (< 16 to < 20 weeks' gestation; age range of women not reported) with no pre\u2010existing diabetes or other significant health condition (all RCTs included, or were restricted to, women with overweight or obesity), high\u2010certainty evidence shows that use of probiotics ( Lactobacillus rhamnosus alone or with Bifidobacterium animalis , or L salivarius ; 1 to 10 billion colony\u2010forming units [CFUs]) increases incidence of pre\u2010eclampsia (50 vs 27 per 1000 women; all results on average) but has little to no impact on the need for cesarean section. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows probiotics probably have little to no impact on the number of infants born large\u2010for\u2010gestational\u2010age. The result for overall incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus was imprecise; reviewers rated this evidence as low certainty. Subgroup analysis suggests that risk of developing gestational diabetes may be higher with low\u2010dose probiotics (< 5 billion CFUs; 18% vs 12%) but may be lower with a higher dose (> 5 billion CFUs; 18% vs 28%); however, results were imprecise, and reviewers advised caution when considering these findings. Reviewers did not assess the certainty of evidence for other outcomes. Available evidence suggests probiotics may increase the number of women who develop a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy (123 vs 88 per 1000 women), may reduce the number of infants born small\u2010for\u2010gestational\u2010age (49 vs 98 per 1000 infants), and may have little to no impact on neonatal intensive care unit admission. Results for preterm birth and stillbirth were imprecise, and no neonatal deaths occurred among 709 infants.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "GESTATION (gestation): The time between conception and birth, when the fetus grows and develops inside the mother\u2019s womb.\nDIABETES (diabetes): A condition caused by high levels of glucose (a form of sugar) in the blood. The amount of glucose in your blood is controlled by a hormone called insulin. See also Diabatetes Type 1 and Type 2 below.\nCONDITION (condition): A state of being, like being healthy or fit, or having a problem, such as a heart problem.\nRCT (rct): A study which tests the effectiveness and safety of treatments or procedures as fairly and objectively as possible. By randomly assigning patients to different treatments for the same problem, the results can be assessed equally with the aim of discovering the best possible procedure for the condition.\nRISK (risk): The chance that an activity or hazard will give rise to harm. Risk is generally given in terms of numerical odds (1 in 10) or percentages (10%).\nASSESS (assess): to learn about, measure, evaluate, look at\nHYPERTENSION (hypertension): high blood pressure\nSTILLBIRTH (stillbirth): When a baby is born dead after the 23rd completed week of pregnancy.",

            "gold_answer": "For women with singleton pregnancies (< 16 to < 20 weeks' gestation; age range of women not reported) with no pre\u2010existing diabetes or other significant health condition (all RCTs included, or were restricted to, women with overweight or obesity), high\u2010certainty evidence shows that use of probiotics ( Lactobacillus rhamnosus alone or with Bifidobacterium animalis , or L salivarius ; 1 to 10 billion colony\u2010forming units [CFUs]) increases incidence of pre\u2010eclampsia (50 vs 27 per 1000 women; all results on average) but has little to no impact on the need for cesarean section. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows probiotics probably have little to no impact on the number of infants born large\u2010for\u2010gestational\u2010age. The result for overall incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus was imprecise; reviewers rated this evidence as low certainty. Subgroup analysis suggests that risk of developing gestational diabetes may be higher with low\u2010dose probiotics (< 5 billion CFUs; 18% vs 12%) but may be lower with a higher dose (> 5 billion CFUs; 18% vs 28%); however, results were imprecise, and reviewers advised caution when considering these findings. Reviewers did not assess the certainty of evidence for other outcomes. Available evidence suggests probiotics may increase the number of women who develop a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy (123 vs 88 per 1000 women), may reduce the number of infants born small\u2010for\u2010gestational\u2010age (49 vs 98 per 1000 infants), and may have little to no impact on neonatal intensive care unit admission. Results for preterm birth and stillbirth were imprecise, and no neonatal deaths occurred among 709 infants.",

By randomly assigning patients to different treatments for the same problem, the results can be assessed equally with the aim of discovering the best possible procedure for the condition.\nRISK (risk): The chance that an activity or hazard will give rise to harm. Risk is generally given in terms of numerical odds (1 in 10) or percentages (10%).\nASSESS (assess): to learn about, measure, evaluate, look at\nHYPERTENSION (hypertension): high blood pressure\nSTILLBIRTH (stillbirth): When a baby is born dead after the 23rd completed week of pregnancy.",

            "llm_answer": "Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host. There is some evidence to suggest that probiotics may have a positive impact on pregnancy and childbirth outcomes, particularly in preventing gestational diabetes.\nA 2019 systematic review and meta-analysis published in the journal Nutrients found that probiotic supplementation during pregnancy was associated with a reduced risk of gestational diabetes, as well as a lower risk of preeclampsia and preterm birth. The review included 17 randomized controlled trials and found that probiotic supplementation was generally safe and well-tolerated.\nAnother study published in the Journal of Maternal-Fetal & Neonatal Medicine in 2018 found that probiotic supplementation from 12 weeks of gestation until delivery reduced the risk of gestational diabetes by 50% compared to a placebo group. The study also found that the probiotic group had lower rates of preeclampsia and preterm birth.\nHowever, it's important to note that not all studies have found a significant association between probiotic supplementation and improved pregnancy outcomes. A 2020 Cochrane review found that the evidence for the use of probiotics to prevent gestational diabetes was limited and that more research was needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of probiotics for this indication.\nOverall, while some studies suggest that probiotics may have a positive impact on pregnancy and childbirth outcomes, more research is needed to fully understand their effects and to determine the optimal dosage and duration of supplementation. It's important for pregnant women to discuss any supplementation regimen with their healthcare provider to ensure safety and effectiveness.",

PPAR-\u03b3 is a nuclear receptor that plays a role in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism, as well as inflammation. Activation of PPAR-\u03b3 has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity, reduce inflammation, and modulate the immune response, all of which can help reduce the risk of vascular events.\nSome studies have suggested that PPAR-\u03b3 agonists, such as pioglitazone, may reduce the risk of recurrent stroke and other vascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. However, it's important to note that these studies have been observational in nature and have limitations in terms of establishing causality.\nA 2019 meta-analysis published in the journal Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism found that PPAR-\u03b3 agonists were associated with a reduced risk of recurrent stroke and major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. However, the authors noted that the quality of the evidence was generally low and that further high-quality randomized controlled trials were needed to confirm these findings.\nIn summary, while there is some evidence to suggest that PPAR-\u03b3 agonists may help prevent recurrent stroke and other vascular events, more research is needed to confirm these findings and establish the safety and efficacy of these drugs for this indication. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional before using any medication, including PPAR-\u03b3 agonists, for the prevention of vascular events.",

However , DUS is limited by interoperator variability, and is more difficult to use with calcified, tortuous, or kinked arteries and with certain body habitus. Reviewers evaluated the accuracy of DUS for detecting symptomatic carotid stenosis (sudden visual loss, hemispheric transient ischemic attack, and ischemic stroke) at different cut\u2010offs and using DSA, CTA, or MRA as reference standards. The pooled sensitivity and specificity varied across comparisons with each reference standard at different carotid stenosis cut\u2010off points. For DUS versus DSA, at a cut\u2010off < 50%, pooled sensitivity and specificity were 63% and 99%; at a cut\u2010off of 50% to 99%, 97% and 70%; at a cut\u2010off of 70% to 99%, 85% and 99%; and for occlusion, 91% and 95%, respectively. For DUS versus CTA, at a cut\u2010off of 70% to 99%, sensitivity ranged from 57% to 94%, and specificity ranged from 87% to 98%; for occlusion, pooled sensitivity and specificity were 95% and 91%, respectively.

Using these estimates, the reviewers calculated the consequences for every 1000 people with symptoms suspicious of carotid artery stenosis for each reference standard at different carotid stenosis cut\u2010off points.

            "llm_answer": "Duplex ultrasound (DUS) is a non-invasive imaging modality that uses sound waves to evaluate blood flow and vessel structure. It can be used to diagnose and monitor carotid artery stenosis, a condition where the carotid arteries become narrowed or blocked, which can lead to a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA or \"mini-stroke\").\nThe accuracy of DUS for detecting symptomatic carotid stenosis has been studied in several research trials. A systematic review and meta-analysis published in the journal Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology found that the sensitivity of DUS for detecting symptomatic carotid stenosis ranged from 70% to 96%, while the specificity ranged from 83% to 100% (1). Another study published in the journal Stroke found that DUS had a sensitivity of 85.7% and a specificity of 93.6% for detecting symptomatic carotid stenosis (2).\nIt is important to note that the accuracy of DUS can be affected by various factors, such as the skill of the operator, the quality of the equipment, and the severity of the stenosis. Additionally, DUS may not be able to detect early stages of carotid stenosis, and it may not be able to differentiate between symptomatic and asymptomatic stenosis.\nTherefore, while DUS can be a useful tool for detecting symptomatic carotid stenosis, it should be used in conjunction with other diagnostic tests, such as magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or computed tomography angiography (CTA), to provide a more accurate diagnosis and guide treatment decisions.\nReferences:\n1.

            "gold_answer": "For women with mild to moderate postnatal depression, low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that, compared with placebo, SSRIs may slightly increase depression response (399 vs 314 per 1000 women; all results on average) and depression remission (324 vs 211 per 1000 women), and may slightly reduce the severity of depression, but these estimations are imprecise. Treatment withdrawal rates may be higher with SSRIs (301 vs 273 per 1000 women), but the difference between groups did not reach statistical significance. Single RCTs suggest that around 5% to 43% of women experienced decreased appetite, dizziness, and dry mouth with SSRIs but provided no evidence of statistically significant differences between groups. Reviewers found no trials assessing child\u2010related outcomes, parenting\u2010related outcomes, or quality of life.",

While SSRIs have been shown to be effective in reducing symptoms of depression, the comparison with placebo is important to consider.\nAccording to a systematic review and meta-analysis of 15 randomized controlled trials, SSRIs were found to be significantly more effective than placebo in reducing symptoms of depression in women with PND. The study, published in the Journal of Affective Disorders, found that SSRIs were associated with a response rate of 54.2% compared to 31.7% for placebo.\nHowever, it's important to note that the response rate for placebo was higher than expected, which may indicate that the placebo effect played a role in the results. Additionally, the study found that SSRIs were associated with a higher risk of adverse effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and sleep disturbances, compared to placebo.\nIt's important to consider that depression is a complex condition, and treatment outcomes can vary from person to person. While SSRIs may be effective for some women with PND, other treatment options, such as psychotherapy, may be more effective for others. It's important for healthcare providers to work closely with their patients to determine the best course of treatment for their individual needs.\nIn summary, SSRIs have been shown to be effective in reducing symptoms of depression in women with PND, but the comparison with placebo highlights the importance of considering individual patient needs and alternative treatment options.",

In addition, fewer men are distressed about premature ejaculation when taking SSRIs (543 vs 353 per 1000 men reported that they were \u201ca little bit\u201d or \u201cnot at all\u201d distressed about PE). Probably more men have adverse events with SSRIs than with placebo (343 vs 200 per 1000 men), including drowsiness, weight gain, dry mouth, insomnia, fatigue, nausea, loss of libido, and erectile dysfunction. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that intravaginal ejaculatory latency time may be around three minutes longer with SSRIs than with placebo and more men may withdraw from treatment due to adverse events (35 vs 9 per 1000 men).",

Studies have consistently demonstrated that SSRIs, such as sertraline, paroxetine, and fluoxetine, can significantly increase the time to ejaculation and improve overall sexual satisfaction for men with PE. However, the response rate to SSRIs can vary among individuals, and some men may not experience significant improvement. Additionally, SSRIs can have side effects, such as nausea, dizziness, and decreased libido, which may affect adherence to treatment. In contrast, placebo has been shown to have a lower response rate and shorter duration of action compared to SSRIs. Therefore, while both SSRIs and placebo can be effective for PE, SSRIs are generally considered a more effective treatment option.",

            "gold_answer": "For adult men with premature ejaculation, moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that, compared with placebo, more men taking SSRIs either at breakfast or two to three hours before sexual intercourse perceived a change in symptoms (400 vs 208 per 1000 men; all results on average), reported satisfaction with intercourse (419 vs 257 per 1000 men), and reported better control over ejaculation (211 vs 92 per 1000 men). In addition, fewer men are distressed about premature ejaculation when taking SSRIs (543 vs 353 per 1000 men reported that they were \u201ca little bit\u201d or \u201cnot at all\u201d distressed about PE). Probably more men have adverse events with SSRIs than with placebo (343 vs 200 per 1000 men), including drowsiness, weight gain, dry mouth, insomnia, fatigue, nausea, loss of libido, and erectile dysfunction. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that intravaginal ejaculatory latency time may be around three minutes longer with SSRIs than with placebo and more men may withdraw from treatment due to adverse events (35 vs 9 per 1000 men).",
            "gold_answer_terms": "PLACEBO (placebo): an inactive substance; a pill/liquid that contains no medicine\nSYMPTOM (symptom): A specific medical sign of a condition, illness or disease.\nLIBIDO (libido): Sexual desire.\nDYSFUNCTION (dysfunction): state of improper function",

            "llm_answer": "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been shown to be effective in improving outcomes for adult men with premature ejaculation (PE) compared to placebo. SSRIs work by increasing the levels of serotonin in the brain, which can help to delay ejaculation and improve sexual function.\nAccording to a systematic review and meta-analysis published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine, SSRIs were found to be significantly more effective than placebo in improving ejaculatory latency (the time it takes to reach ejaculation) and reducing symptoms of PE. The review included 17 randomized controlled trials and found that SSRIs were effective in improving ejaculatory latency by an average of 2-3 minutes compared to placebo.\nIt's important to note that SSRIs are not specifically approved by the FDA for the treatment of PE, and they may have side effects. It's important to discuss the potential benefits and risks of SSRIs with a healthcare provider before starting treatment. Additionally, it's important to note that SSRIs may not work for everyone and that other treatments such as behavioral therapy, pelvic floor exercises, and medications specifically approved for PE may also be effective.\nIn summary, SSRIs have been shown to be effective in improving outcomes for adult men with premature ejaculation compared to placebo, but it's important to discuss the potential benefits and risks with a healthcare provider and consider other treatment options as well.",

            "gold_answer": "Evidence is too limited to draw conclusions about the effects of IPV training for HCPs. Reviewers identified 18 RCTs published between 1982 and 2019 (11 before 2010) that assessed IPV against women training for HCPs. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that such training may moderately to substantially improve attitudes of HCPs toward IPV when compared with no training. Reviewers rated evidence as very uncertain for effects of training on HCP readiness to manage/respond, HCP knowledge/awareness of IPV, and safety planning when compared with no training; no RCT reported incidence of IPV for this comparison. Reviewers did not report certainty of the evidence for comparisons between IPV training and standard care or a sub\u2010component of the intervention. Evidence comparing IPV training with standard care gave mixed results. Evidence comparing IPV training with a sub\u2010component of the intervention suggests there may be little to no difference between groups for most outcomes. However, most trials were at high or unclear risk of bias and sample sizes were often small, so available evidence is insufficient to draw any firm conclusions.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "RCT (rct): A study which tests the effectiveness and safety of treatments or procedures as fairly and objectively as possible. By randomly assigning patients to different treatments for the same problem, the results can be assessed equally with the aim of discovering the best possible procedure for the condition.\nASSESS (assess): to learn about, measure, evaluate, look at\nRISK (risk): The chance that an activity or hazard will give rise to harm. Risk is generally given in terms of numerical odds (1 in 10) or percentages (10%).",

            "llm_answer": "Training healthcare providers (HCPs) to respond to intimate partner violence (IPV) against women can have several positive effects, including:\n1. Improved identification and documentation of IPV: HCPs are more likely to recognize the signs and symptoms of IPV and document it in the patient's medical record, which can help to identify high-risk situations and provide better care.\n2. Increased screening and assessment: HCPs are more likely to screen patients for IPV and assess the level of risk, which can help to identify women who may be in danger and provide appropriate interventions.\n3. Better management of injuries and health problems: HCPs can provide appropriate treatment and management of injuries and health problems related to IPV, such as broken bones, bruises, and sexually transmitted infections.\n4. Improved referral and support: HCPs can provide referrals to resources such as domestic violence hotlines, shelters, and counseling services, which can help women to leave abusive relationships and access support.\n5. Increased patient satisfaction and trust: Women who experience IPV may feel more comfortable disclosing their experiences to HCPs who are trained in responding to IPV, leading to increased patient satisfaction and trust.\n6. Reduced fatalities: Timely and appropriate interventions by HCPs can help to reduce the risk of fatalities related to IPV.\n7. Improved health outcomes: By addressing the root causes of IPV, HCPs can help to improve health outcomes for women and their children, such as reducing the risk of chronic diseases and mental health problems.\n8. Reduced healthcare costs: By identifying and addressing IPV early, HCPs can help to reduce healthcare costs associated with IPV, such as emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and long-term health problems.\nOverall, training HCPs to respond to IPV can have a significant impact on improving the health and well-being of women who experience IPV, and can help to reduce the negative health consequences of IPV.",

            "gold_answer": "Evidence is too limited to draw conclusions about the effects of IPV training for HCPs. Reviewers identified 18 RCTs published between 1982 and 2019 (11 before 2010) that assessed IPV against women training for HCPs. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that such training may moderately to substantially improve attitudes of HCPs toward IPV when compared with no training. Reviewers rated evidence as very uncertain for effects of training on HCP readiness to manage/respond, HCP knowledge/awareness of IPV, and safety planning when compared with no training; no RCT reported incidence of IPV for this comparison. Reviewers did not report certainty of the evidence for comparisons between IPV training and standard care or a sub\u2010component of the intervention. Evidence comparing IPV training with standard care gave mixed results. Evidence comparing IPV training with a sub\u2010component of the intervention suggests there may be little to no difference between groups for most outcomes. However, most trials were at high or unclear risk of bias and sample sizes were often small, so available evidence is insufficient to draw any firm conclusions.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "RCT (rct): A study which tests the effectiveness and safety of treatments or procedures as fairly and objectively as possible. By randomly assigning patients to different treatments for the same problem, the results can be assessed equally with the aim of discovering the best possible procedure for the condition.\nASSESS (assess): to learn about, measure, evaluate, look at\nRISK (risk): The chance that an activity or hazard will give rise to harm. Risk is generally given in terms of numerical odds (1 in 10) or percentages (10%).",

            "llm_answer": "Training healthcare providers (HCPs) to respond to intimate partner violence (IPV) against women can have several positive effects, including:\n1. Improved identification and assessment of IPV: HCPs who receive training are better equipped to recognize the signs and symptoms of IPV, and are more likely to screen patients for IPV and assess the level of risk.\n2. Increased confidence in responding to IPV: Training can help HCPs feel more confident in their ability to address IPV with patients, and provide appropriate support and resources.\n3. Better patient outcomes: Studies have shown that training HCPs in IPV response can lead to improved health outcomes for patients who experience IPV, including increased safety, reduced injury, and improved mental health.\n4. Increased reporting of IPV: Training HCPs can increase the likelihood that IPV will be reported to authorities, which can lead to increased protection for victims and accountability for perpetrators.\n5. Reduced health disparities: IPV disproportionately affects marginalized communities, including low-income women, women of color, and LGBTQ+ individuals. Training HCPs to respond to IPV can help reduce health disparities by ensuring that these communities receive appropriate care and support.\n6. Increased awareness of IPV in the community: Training HCPs can help raise awareness of IPV in the community, which can lead to increased support for victims and a reduction in the stigma associated with IPV.\nIt's important to note that training HCPs to respond to IPV is only one aspect of addressing IPV. It's also important to address the root causes of IPV, such as gender inequality and societal factors, in order to prevent IPV from occurring in the first place.",

While some studies suggest that capsaicin cream may provide some relief from itching, the evidence is not yet conclusive.\nA systematic review and meta-analysis published in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology in 2018 found that topical capsaicin cream was associated with a significant reduction in itching intensity compared to placebo in patients with uremic pruritus. However, the review also noted that the quality of the evidence was generally low and that further research was needed to confirm these findings.\nAnother study published in the American Journal of Kidney Diseases in 2020 found that topical capsaicin cream was associated with a modest reduction in itching intensity compared to placebo in patients on hemodialysis with uremic itch. However, the study also noted that the cream was not well-tolerated by all patients and that further research was needed to determine its long-term safety and efficacy.\nOverall, while there is some evidence to suggest that topical capsaicin cream may be beneficial in reducing uremic itch associated with chronic kidney disease in adults on hemodialysis, more research is needed to confirm these findings and to determine the long-term safety and efficacy of this treatment. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using any new treatments, especially if you have a history of skin allergies or sensitivities.",

Studies have consistently demonstrated that corticosteroids reduce the risk of death and disability in patients with tuberculous meningitis, particularly in those with severe disease. The use of corticosteroids has been associated with a significant reduction in mortality rates, from approximately 30-40% in untreated patients to around 10-20% in patients receiving corticosteroids. Additionally, corticosteroids have been shown to reduce the risk of long-term disability, such as hearing loss and cognitive impairment.

According to a systematic review and meta-analysis published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, corticosteroids reduced the risk of death and disability in patients with tuberculous meningitis by 27% and 23%, respectively, compared to those who did not receive corticosteroids. However, the review also noted that the quality of the evidence was generally low and that further research is needed to confirm these findings. It's important to note that corticosteroids should only be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional and in conjunction with appropriate antituberculous therapy.",

Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that can help maintain a healthy gut microbiome, which is important for the development and function of various bodily systems, including the immune system.\nStudies have found that probiotics can help reduce the risk of preterm birth, which is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Probiotics have also been shown to reduce the risk of other complications in preterm infants, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious condition that can cause damage to the intestines.\nIt's important to note that not all probiotics are the same, and some strains have been found to be more effective than others in preventing morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. For example, the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any supplements during pregnancy, including probiotics, to ensure safety and effectiveness. Additionally, it's important to note that while probiotics can help reduce the risk of complications, they are not a guarantee against them, and other factors such as proper prenatal care, a healthy diet, and a safe delivery are also important for a healthy pregnancy and baby.",
