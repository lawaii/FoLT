            "llm_answer": "There are several iron chelators available for the treatment of iron overload in people with sickle cell disease or thalassemia, and the choice of chelator can impact adherence to treatment. Here are some commonly used iron chelators and their comparisons in terms of adherence:\n1. Deferoxamine (Desferal): This is an older iron chelator that has been used for decades. It is given by subcutaneous injection and has a long half-life, which means it stays in the body for a longer period. Deferoxamine can cause local site reactions, muscle pain, and GI disturbances, which can affect adherence.\n2. Deferasirox (Exjade): This is an oral iron chelator that is taken once daily. It has a shorter half-life compared to deferoxamine and is generally better tolerated. However, it can cause GI disturbances, skin rash, and liver enzyme elevations, which can impact adherence.\n3. Deferiprone (Ferriprox): This is another oral iron chelator that is taken three times a day. It has a shorter half-life than deferoxamine and is generally well-tolerated. However, it can cause GI disturbances, skin rash, and bone marrow suppression, which can affect adherence.\n4. Iron-binding agents: These are newer iron chelators that bind to iron in the gut and prevent its absorption. They include agents such as sucrosomial iron and ferric citrate. These agents are generally well-tolerated and have fewer side effects compared to other iron chelators. However, their efficacy in reducing iron overload may be lower compared to other chelators.\nIn terms of adherence, deferasirox and deferiprone have been shown to have better adherence rates compared to deferoxamine, likely due to their oral formulation and fewer side effects. Iron-binding agents have also been shown to have good adherence rates due to their milder side effect profile.\nIt's important to note that adherence to iron chelation therapy is critical to achieve optimal",

Duration of fever from treatment onset was probably shorter (by four days). There were two cases of coronary thrombus in children receiving ASA alone, compared with none in the IVIG plus ASA group, and no deaths were reported (low\u2010certainty evidence). Results for adverse effects were very uncertain, and length of hospital stay was not assessed in any trial.",

IVIG has been found to reduce the risk of aneurysm formation by 70-80% compared to ASA alone. Additionally, IVIG has been shown to reduce the risk of disease recurrence and improve symptoms such as fever and joint pain. However, IVIG is associated with a higher risk of adverse effects, including infections and infusion reactions.

Reduced inflammation: JAK inhibitors can reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are molecules that promote inflammation in the body. This can help to reduce the severity of symptoms such as fever, cough, and shortness of breath.\n2. Improved lung function: JAK inhibitors have been shown to improve lung function in people with COVID-19, which can help to increase oxygen levels in the blood and improve overall respiratory health.\n3. Reduced risk of complications: JAK inhibitors may reduce the risk of complications associated with COVID-19, such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multi-organ failure.\n4. Shorter hospital stay: In some studies, JAK inhibitors have been shown to reduce the length of hospital stay for people with moderate to severe COVID-19.\n5. Improved survival: Some studies have suggested that JAK inhibitors may improve survival rates for people with severe COVID-19, particularly those who are hospitalized and require oxygen therapy.\nIt's important to note that the effects of JAK inhibitors on COVID-19 are still being studied, and more research is needed to fully understand their benefits and risks. Additionally, JAK inhibitors are not a cure for COVID-19, and they are not a substitute for other treatments that are recommended for the virus, such as antiviral medications and supportive care.",

Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that compared with standard care alone, JAK inhibitors probably also reduce the number of people with worsening of clinical status (155 vs 172 per 1000 people) and the number of people who experience serious adverse events (142 vs 180 per 1000 people), but do not seem to improve clinical status or increase the risk of adverse events.

JAK inhibitors work by blocking the activity of enzymes called janus kinases, which play a role in the immune system and inflammation.\nStudies have suggested that JAK inhibitors may help reduce the severity of COVID-19 symptoms, including fever, cough, and shortness of breath, in people with moderate to severe disease. They may also help reduce the risk of complications such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\nHowever, it's important to note that JAK inhibitors are not a cure for COVID-19, and they are not a substitute for other treatments that are recommended for people with severe COVID-19, such as corticosteroids and mechanical ventilation. Additionally, JAK inhibitors can have side effects, including an increased risk of infections and changes in blood cell counts.\nIt's also important to note that the use of JAK inhibitors for COVID-19 is still being studied, and more research is needed to fully understand their effects and to determine their long-term safety and effectiveness. As with any medication, it's important to discuss the potential benefits and risks of JAK inhibitors with a healthcare professional before starting treatment.\nIn summary, JAK inhibitors may have potential benefits for people with moderate to severe COVID-19, but more research is needed to fully understand their effects and to determine their long-term safety and effectiveness.

The evidence for shorter follow\u2010up is similar to that for long\u2010term effects but is more uncertain. One small trial found minimal to no important difference in quality of life in the short term (up to two months). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that withdrawing cholinesterase inhibitors may result in minimal to no important difference in withdrawal from treatment due to lack of efficacy of trial medication or deterioration in overall medical condition, adverse events (any, serious), or mortality, but analyses may have been underpowered.",

Withdrawing these medications in people with dementia can have both benefits and harms.\nBenefits:\n* Reduced risk of adverse effects: Cholinesterase inhibitors can cause side effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and insomnia. Withdrawing the medication can help alleviate these symptoms and improve the patient's quality of life.\n* Reduced financial burden: Cholinesterase inhibitors can be expensive, and withdrawing them can help reduce the financial burden on the patient and their caregivers.\n* Potential for improved cognitive function: Some studies suggest that withdrawing cholinesterase inhibitors may improve cognitive function in some patients, particularly those with mild cognitive impairment.\nHarms:\n* Decline in cognitive function: Cholinesterase inhibitors can help improve cognitive function in people with dementia, and withdrawing them may lead to a decline in cognitive function, including memory, attention, and problem-solving abilities.\n* Loss of benefits: Cholinesterase inhibitors have been shown to have neuroprotective effects, and withdrawing them may result in the loss of these benefits, potentially leading to further neuronal damage.\n* Increased caregiver burden: Withdrawing cholinesterase inhibitors may increase the burden on caregivers, as the patient's cognitive function declines and they require more assistance with daily activities.\nIt's important to note that the decision to withdraw cholinesterase inhibitors in people with dementia should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the individual patient's needs, benefits, and risks. A healthcare professional should be consulted before making any changes to medication.",

The evidence for shorter follow\u2010up is similar to that for long\u2010term effects but is more uncertain. One small trial found minimal to no important difference in quality of life in the short term (up to two months). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that withdrawing cholinesterase inhibitors may result in minimal to no important difference in withdrawal from treatment due to lack of efficacy of trial medication or deterioration in overall medical condition, adverse events (any, serious), or mortality, but analyses may have been underpowered.",

            "llm_answer": "Cholinesterase inhibitors are a type of medication commonly used to treat dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease. Withdrawing these medications in people with dementia can have both benefits and harms.\nBenefits:\n1. Improved cognitive function: Some studies suggest that withdrawing cholinesterase inhibitors may improve cognitive function in people with dementia, particularly in those with mild to moderate disease.\n2. Reduced risk of adverse effects: Cholinesterase inhibitors can have adverse effects, such as gastrointestinal symptoms, muscle weakness, and bradycardia. Withdrawing these medications may reduce the risk of these adverse effects.\n3. Potential for disease modification: Some research suggests that withdrawing cholinesterase inhibitors may allow for disease modification, potentially slowing down or halting the progression of dementia.\nHarms:\n1. Worsening of cognitive function: Withdrawing cholinesterase inhibitors may worsen cognitive function in some people with dementia, particularly those with more advanced disease.\n2. Loss of benefits: Cholinesterase inhibitors have been shown to provide some benefits for people with dementia, such as improved cognitive function and slowed disease progression. Withdrawing these medications may result in the loss of these benefits.\n3. Potential for withdrawal symptoms: Sudden withdrawal of cholinesterase inhibitors may result in withdrawal symptoms, such as agitation, aggression, and hallucinations.\nIt's important to note that the decision to withdraw cholinesterase inhibitors in people with dementia should be made on a case-by-case basis, in consultation with a healthcare professional. A gradual tapering of the medication under the guidance of a healthcare professional may be necessary to minimize the risk of withdrawal symptoms. Additionally, it's important to monitor the person's cognitive function and overall well-being closely during and after the withdrawal process.",

            "gold_answer": "For women undergoing first\u2010trimester abortion, combined mifepristone/prostaglandin at higher misoprostol dose, shorter intervals, and using the vaginal route instead of the oral route probably reduces failures to achieve complete abortion with minimal to no effect on nausea. For women undergoing first\u2010trimester abortion, moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that compared with a half dose of misoprostol, probably fewer women failed to achieve complete abortion (68 vs 109 per 1000 women, all results on average) or were dissatisfied (65 vs 87 per 1000 women) with misoprostol 800 \u00b5g + mifepristone 200 mg, with minimal to no effect on nausea. There is probably minimal to no difference between mifepristone 600 mg + prostaglandin versus mifepristone 200 mg + prostaglandin in failure to achieve complete abortion and nausea (moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that probably more women failed to achieve complete abortion with combined regimens containing misoprostol 800 \u00b5g vaginally with longer than with shorter intervals (3 days vs 1 day; 40 vs 20 per 1000 women), and with oral mifepristone plus misoprostol than with oral mifepristone and vaginal misoprostol (76 vs 32 per 1000 women). Fewer women may fail to achieve complete abortion with combined regimens with sublingual than with oral misoprostol (15 vs 60 per 1000 women). The effect of combined regimens containing sublingual or buccal misoprostol versus vaginal misoprostol for achieving complete abortion is imprecise. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that more women may have nausea with combined regimens using oral than vaginal misoprostol (521 vs 459 per 1000 women). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that the provision of medical methods of abortion at home versus hospital results in minimal to no important difference in achieving complete abortion, nausea, and women's dissatisfaction with the procedure, with very uncertain evidence regarding blood transfusions. More women may fail to achieve complete abortion with nurses than with doctors providing these medical methods (61 vs 23 per 1000 women; low\u2010certainty evidence), but the evidence for women's dissatisfaction with this strategy is very uncertain.",

            "llm_answer": "The effects of different routes, doses, and administration strategies of combined mifepristone/prostaglandin for women undergoing first-trimester abortion have been studied in various clinical trials. Here are some key findings:\n* Route of administration: Mifepristone and prostaglandin can be administered orally, vaginally, or sublingually. Studies have shown that the efficacy and safety of the combination are similar across different routes, with some advantages and disadvantages to each method. For example, oral administration is more convenient, but may have a lower bioavailability compared to vaginal or sublingual administration.\n* Dose of mifepristone: The standard dose of mifepristone for first-trimester abortion is 200-400 mg, taken orally or vaginally. Higher doses (e.g., 600 mg) may be more effective, but may also increase side effects such as nausea and vomiting.\n* Dose of prostaglandin: The standard dose of prostaglandin for first-trimester abortion is 400-800 \u03bcg, taken orally or vaginally. Higher doses (e.g., 1000 \u03bcg) may be more effective, but may also increase side effects such as cramping and bleeding.\n* Timing of administration: Mifepristone can be taken 24-48 hours before prostaglandin, or simultaneously with prostaglandin. Some studies suggest that simultaneous administration may be more effective and have fewer side effects.\n* Route and dose of prostaglandin: The choice of prostaglandin route and dose may depend on the gestational age of the pregnancy. For example, vaginal administration of 400 \u03bcg misoprostol may be more effective for pregnancies up to 7 weeks, while higher doses (e.g., 800 \u03bcg) may be needed for pregnancies 8-10 weeks.\n* Side effects: Common side effects of combined mifepristone/prostaglandin include cramping, bleeding, nause",

            "gold_answer": "For women undergoing first\u2010trimester abortion, combined mifepristone/prostaglandin at higher misoprostol dose, shorter intervals, and using the vaginal route instead of the oral route probably reduces failures to achieve complete abortion with minimal to no effect on nausea. For women undergoing first\u2010trimester abortion, moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that compared with a half dose of misoprostol, probably fewer women failed to achieve complete abortion (68 vs 109 per 1000 women, all results on average) or were dissatisfied (65 vs 87 per 1000 women) with misoprostol 800 \u00b5g + mifepristone 200 mg, with minimal to no effect on nausea. There is probably minimal to no difference between mifepristone 600 mg + prostaglandin versus mifepristone 200 mg + prostaglandin in failure to achieve complete abortion and nausea (moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that probably more women failed to achieve complete abortion with combined regimens containing misoprostol 800 \u00b5g vaginally with longer than with shorter intervals (3 days vs 1 day; 40 vs 20 per 1000 women), and with oral mifepristone plus misoprostol than with oral mifepristone and vaginal misoprostol (76 vs 32 per 1000 women). Fewer women may fail to achieve complete abortion with combined regimens with sublingual than with oral misoprostol (15 vs 60 per 1000 women). The effect of combined regimens containing sublingual or buccal misoprostol versus vaginal misoprostol for achieving complete abortion is imprecise. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that more women may have nausea with combined regimens using oral than vaginal misoprostol (521 vs 459 per 1000 women). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that the provision of medical methods of abortion at home versus hospital results in minimal to no important difference in achieving complete abortion, nausea, and women's dissatisfaction with the procedure, with very uncertain evidence regarding blood transfusions. More women may fail to achieve complete abortion with nurses than with doctors providing these medical methods (61 vs 23 per 1000 women; low\u2010certainty evidence), but the evidence for women's dissatisfaction with this strategy is very uncertain.",

            "gold_answer": "High\u2010certainty evidence shows little to no impact on mortality when a lower BP target (systolic < 120 to 130 mmHg; diastolic \u2264 75 to 85 mmHg) instead of a standard BP target (systolic < 140 mmHg; diastolic \u2264 90 to 95 mmHg) is implemented for high blood pressure treatment. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that a lower BP target may reduce rates of myocardial infarction (11 vs 13 per 1000 people), stroke (13 vs 15 per 1000 people), and congestive heart failure (16 vs 21 per 1000 people). However, moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that a lower BP target probably increases the number of people experiencing a serious adverse event (on average, 385 vs 371 per 1000 people).",

Additionally, a lower BP target may also reduce the risk of kidney disease and cognitive decline. However, achieving a lower BP target may require more intensive treatment, including lifestyle modifications and medication, and may also increase the risk of adverse effects such as dizziness, lightheadedness, and electrolyte imbalances. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the appropriate BP target for each individual based on their specific health status and circumstances.",

Avoralstat, berotralstat, and lanadelumab may improve quality of life, and the last two drugs may also reduce disability. All these drugs appear not to increase the risk of adverse effects, but the certainty of evidence is mostly low. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that avoralstat probably results in minimal to no difference in preventing HAE attacks at two months compared with placebo. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that berotralstat and C1\u2010INH(SC) may reduce the risk of HAE attacks at 12 and 22 months, respectively (571 vs 913 and 233 vs 810 per 1000 people, respectively; all results on average). There may be fewer HAE attacks per week with berotralstat, C1\u2010INH(SC), pdC1\u2010INH, and lanadelumab (mean difference of 0.39 to 0.81 fewer cases), and minimal to no difference with avoralstat compared with placebo. The effects of nanofiltered C1\u2010INH (C1\u2010INH\u2010nf) and recombinant human C1\u2010INH (rhC1\u2010INH) on number of HAE attacks per week are very uncertain. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that avoralstat and berotralstat probably improve quality of life, and low\u2010certainty evidence also suggests a large benefit with lanadelumab, compared with placebo. There was minimal to no difference between groups with C1\u2010INH(SC) or pdC1\u2010INH, and a very uncertain effect with C1\u2010INH\u2010nf versus placebo. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that berotralstat and lanadelumab may result in large reductions in disability; however, the evidence for the effect of C1\u2010INH\u2010nf on disability is very uncertain. Based on low\u2010 to moderate\u2010certainty evidence, there was little to no difference in adverse events for all drugs compared with placebo; no study assessed this outcome with C1\u2010INH\u2010nf. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests there is minimal to no difference between groups in serious adverse events with berotralstat and lanadelumab compared with placebo, and the effect with the other drugs is very uncertain.

C1 esterase inhibitors: These drugs, such as Cinryze and Haegarda, work by replacing the missing or dysfunctional C1 esterase enzyme that is responsible for the condition. They have been shown to significantly reduce the frequency and severity of HAE attacks.\n2. Bradykinin receptor antagonists: These drugs, such as icatibant and faselisib, work by blocking the action of bradykinin, a protein that is involved in the development of HAE attacks. They have been shown to be effective in reducing the frequency and severity of HAE attacks.\n3. Kallikrein inhibitors: These drugs, such as lanabecestat, work by blocking the activity of kallikrein, an enzyme that is involved in the production of bradykinin. They have been shown to be effective in reducing the frequency and severity of HAE attacks.\nIn contrast, placebo has been shown to be less effective than these drugs in preventing HAE attacks. In clinical trials, placebo has been associated with a higher frequency and severity of HAE attacks compared to the drugs mentioned above.\nIt's important to note that the choice of drug and dosing regimen for HAE attack prevention may vary depending on the individual patient and their specific needs.

Avoralstat, berotralstat, and lanadelumab may improve quality of life, and the last two drugs may also reduce disability. All these drugs appear not to increase the risk of adverse effects, but the certainty of evidence is mostly low. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that avoralstat probably results in minimal to no difference in preventing HAE attacks at two months compared with placebo. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that berotralstat and C1\u2010INH(SC) may reduce the risk of HAE attacks at 12 and 22 months, respectively (571 vs 913 and 233 vs 810 per 1000 people, respectively; all results on average). There may be fewer HAE attacks per week with berotralstat, C1\u2010INH(SC), pdC1\u2010INH, and lanadelumab (mean difference of 0.39 to 0.81 fewer cases), and minimal to no difference with avoralstat compared with placebo. The effects of nanofiltered C1\u2010INH (C1\u2010INH\u2010nf) and recombinant human C1\u2010INH (rhC1\u2010INH) on number of HAE attacks per week are very uncertain. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that avoralstat and berotralstat probably improve quality of life, and low\u2010certainty evidence also suggests a large benefit with lanadelumab, compared with placebo. There was minimal to no difference between groups with C1\u2010INH(SC) or pdC1\u2010INH, and a very uncertain effect with C1\u2010INH\u2010nf versus placebo. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that berotralstat and lanadelumab may result in large reductions in disability; however, the evidence for the effect of C1\u2010INH\u2010nf on disability is very uncertain. Based on low\u2010 to moderate\u2010certainty evidence, there was little to no difference in adverse events for all drugs compared with placebo; no study assessed this outcome with C1\u2010INH\u2010nf. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests there is minimal to no difference between groups in serious adverse events with berotralstat and lanadelumab compared with placebo, and the effect with the other drugs is very uncertain.

            "llm_answer": "I am not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on the topic. Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare genetic disorder that causes recurrent episodes of swelling in various parts of the body. While there is no cure for HAE, various drugs have been studied for their effectiveness in preventing HAE attacks.\nOne common treatment approach for HAE is the use of medications that target the kallikrein-kinin system, which is involved in the development of angioedema. These medications include:\n1. C1 esterase inhibitors: These drugs work by inhibiting the activity of the C1 esterase enzyme, which is involved in the production of bradykinin, a peptide that causes blood vessels to dilate and lead to angioedema. Examples of C1 esterase inhibitors include Cinryze (C1 esterase inhibitor [human]) and Haegarda (C1 esterase inhibitor [human]).\n2. Kallikrein inhibitors: These drugs work by inhibiting the activity of the kallikrein enzyme, which is involved in the production of bradykinin. Examples of kallikrein inhibitors include Takhzyro (lanadelumab) and Orladeyo (berotralstat).\nStudies have shown that these medications can significantly reduce the frequency and severity of HAE attacks compared to placebo. For example, a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that Cinryze reduced the number of HAE attacks by 85% compared to placebo. Another study published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology found that Takhzyro reduced the number of HAE attacks by 87% compared to placebo.\nIt's important to note that these medications may not work for everyone with HAE, and the choice of medication and dosage may vary depending on the individual patient. It's also important to note that these medications can have side effects, so it's important to discuss the potential benefits and risks with a healthcare provider.\nIn summary, C1 esterase inhibitors and kallikrein inhib",

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers conducted an overview of systematic reviews that assessed the effects of supplementation (with iron, zinc, folic acid, or lipid\u2010based nutrient supplementation) or food fortification (with daily micronutrient powders, fortified milk or cereal) for anemia in healthy infants living in low\u2010, middle\u2010, and high\u2010income countries. Compared with control, all forms of supplementation led to a reduction in anemia prevalence (by 21% to 62%; all results on average and on relative terms) and to an increase in hemoglobin levels (from 4.10 g/L to 7.22 g/L difference), except for supplementation with zinc, which resulted in little to no difference between groups. Regarding food fortification, iron\u2010fortified milk, micronutrient powder, and fortified milk reduced anemia (by 18% to 50%). Iron\u2010fortified milk and caterpillar cereal compared with usual diet also increased hemoglobin levels (by 0.6 to 6.20 g/L). Results for hemoglobin levels with other interventions were less consistent. GRADE assessment of the quality of the evidence was not conducted in most reviews, but when it was, the certainty of evidence was low to moderate.",

Iron is essential for the production of hemoglobin, and adequate intake during infancy helps maintain normal red blood cell production. Folic acid and vitamin B12 are important for the synthesis of red blood cells and the maintenance of the nervous system.\nSupplementation or fortification with these nutrients has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of anemia in infants. A systematic review of 17 randomized controlled trials found that iron supplementation in infancy reduced the risk of anemia at 6 months by 77% and at 12 months by 62%. Similarly, folic acid supplementation during pregnancy and lactation has been shown to reduce the risk of anemia in infants.\nHowever, it is important to note that excessive intake of these nutrients can be harmful. High levels of iron can cause gastrointestinal side effects, such as constipation, diarrhea, and vomiting, and may increase the risk of infections. Folic acid supplementation above the recommended level can mask a vitamin B12 deficiency, which can cause neurological damage. Therefore, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider to determine the appropriate dosage and duration of supplementation or fortification.",

            "llm_answer": "Supplementation or food fortification can have a positive effect on preventing anemia in healthy infants. Iron supplements or iron-fortified foods can help ensure that infants receive enough iron to support their rapid growth and development during this critical period. Iron is essential for the production of hemoglobin, which carries oxygen in the blood, and adequate iron intake is necessary to prevent iron-deficiency anemia.\nStudies have shown that iron supplementation or fortification can significantly reduce the risk of anemia in infants. For example, a study published in the Journal of Pediatrics found that infants who received iron-fortified formula had a lower risk of developing anemia compared to those who received unfortified formula. Another study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that iron supplementation in infancy improved cognitive function and motor skills in children at 12 months of age.\nHowever, it's important to note that excessive iron intake can be harmful, so it's essential to follow the recommended dosage and consult with a healthcare professional to determine the appropriate amount for an infant's age and individual needs. Additionally, it's important to ensure that the supplement or fortified food is from a reputable source and meets safety and quality standards.\nIn summary, supplementation or food fortification can be an effective way to prevent anemia in healthy infants, but it's important to follow recommended guidelines and consult with a healthcare professional to ensure safe and appropriate use.",

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers identified multiple RCTs evaluating clinical outcomes in adults receiving patch angioplasty compared with primary closure after undergoing carotid endarterectomy. There was little to no difference reported in rates of stroke (any) at < 30 days postoperation; however, follow\u2010up rates were lower with patch angioplasty than with primary closure at longer term (30 vs 59 per 1000 people; all results on average). A similar effect was reported for ipsilateral stroke at both follow\u2010up times (17 vs 52 per 1000 and 19 vs 59 per 1000 people, respectively). Little to no difference was reported for stroke\u2010related death or all\u2010cause death. RCT evidence indicates a benefit of less operated artery occlusion (7 vs 37 per 1000 people) in people receiving patch angioplasty. Restenosis rates and complications requiring reintervention occurred significantly less often in people receiving patch angioplasty as compared to primary closure for carotid endarterectomy (28 vs 107 per 1000 people). All evidence was of low to very low certainty.",

            "llm_answer": "Patch angioplasty and primary closure are two different techniques used to repair the carotid artery after carotid endarterectomy, a surgical procedure to remove plaque from the artery.\nPatch angioplasty involves using a patch to cover the opening in the artery wall after the plaque has been removed. This technique has been associated with a higher risk of restenosis (the re-narrowing of the artery) and may require additional procedures to maintain the patency of the artery.\nPrimary closure, on the other hand, involves directly closing the opening in the artery wall without the use of a patch. This technique has been shown to have better long-term outcomes, with lower rates of restenosis and fewer requirements for additional procedures.\nTherefore, primary closure is generally considered the preferred technique for adults undergoing carotid endarterectomy, as it provides better long-term outcomes and reduces the need for additional interventions.",

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers identified multiple RCTs evaluating clinical outcomes in adults receiving patch angioplasty compared with primary closure after undergoing carotid endarterectomy. There was little to no difference reported in rates of stroke (any) at < 30 days postoperation; however, follow\u2010up rates were lower with patch angioplasty than with primary closure at longer term (30 vs 59 per 1000 people; all results on average). A similar effect was reported for ipsilateral stroke at both follow\u2010up times (17 vs 52 per 1000 and 19 vs 59 per 1000 people, respectively). Little to no difference was reported for stroke\u2010related death or all\u2010cause death. RCT evidence indicates a benefit of less operated artery occlusion (7 vs 37 per 1000 people) in people receiving patch angioplasty. Restenosis rates and complications requiring reintervention occurred significantly less often in people receiving patch angioplasty as compared to primary closure for carotid endarterectomy (28 vs 107 per 1000 people). All evidence was of low to very low certainty.",

By randomly assigning patients to different treatments for the same problem, the results can be assessed equally with the aim of discovering the best possible procedure for the condition.\nCLINICAL (clinical): pertaining to medical care\nTERM (term): Between 37 and 42 weeks of pregnancy.\nOCCLUSION (occlusion): closing; blockage; obstruction\nCOMPLICATIONS (complications): Problems that develop after an operation, treatment or illness.",

            "llm_answer": "Patch angioplasty and primary closure are two different techniques used to repair the carotid artery after a carotid endarterectomy, a surgical procedure to remove plaque buildup in the carotid artery.\nPatch angioplasty involves using a small tube or patch to repair the artery, while primary closure involves sewing the artery shut without the use of a patch. Both techniques have their advantages and disadvantages.\nPatch angioplasty has been associated with lower rates of restenosis (the re-narrowing of the artery) and lower risk of stroke or TIA (transient ischemic attack) compared to primary closure. However, patch angioplasty may be associated with a higher risk of bleeding complications.\nOn the other hand, primary closure has been associated with higher rates of restenosis compared to patch angioplasty, but it may have a lower risk of bleeding complications.\nIt's important to note that the choice between patch angioplasty and primary closure depends on various factors, such as the patient's medical history, the severity of the blockage, and the surgeon's preference. Your doctor will be able to advise on the best option for you based on your individual circumstances.\nIt's important to consult with a medical professional to determine the best course of treatment for your specific situation.",

Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that can help maintain a healthy gut microbiome, which is important for the development and function of various bodily systems, including the immune system.\nStudies have found that probiotics can help reduce the risk of preterm birth, which is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Probiotics have also been shown to reduce the risk of other complications in preterm infants, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious condition that can cause damage to the intestines.\nIt's important to note that not all probiotics are the same, and some strains have been found to be more effective than others in preventing morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. For example, the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any supplements during pregnancy, including probiotics, to ensure safety and effectiveness. Additionally, it's important to note that while probiotics can help reduce the risk of complications, they are not a guarantee against them, and other factors such as proper prenatal care, a healthy diet, and a safe delivery are also important for a healthy pregnancy and baby.",
