For adults with recent\u2010onset psychosis, low\u2010certainty evidence suggests no clear differences between extended SEI (up to 3 years' further treatment post standard SEI) and standard length SEI (2 to 3 years' treatment) plus treatment as usual (TAU) in terms of rates of recovery (on average, 244 vs 217 per 1000 people). Extended SEI does not seem to reduce the number of hospital stays nor the duration of these stays compared with SEI plus TAU (low\u2010certainty evidence).

Studies have found that these labels and scores can help consumers make healthier choices by increasing their awareness of the nutritional content of the products they purchase.\nTraffic-light labeling, which uses a color-coded system to indicate the nutritional value of a product, has been shown to be particularly effective in influencing consumer behavior. A study published in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics found that traffic-light labeling led to a significant reduction in the sales of sugar-sweetened beverages in a hospital cafeteria setting.\nNutritional rating scores, such as the Nutri-Score, have also been shown to be effective in reducing the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages. A study published in the Journal of Public Health found that the implementation of the Nutri-Score in a French supermarket chain led to a 10% reduction in the sales of sugary drinks.\nOverall, the use of traffic-light labeling and nutritional rating scores can be a useful tool in promoting healthier choices and reducing the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages.",

The evidence for duration of hospitalization, time to resolution of hypoxia, inability to feed or lethargy, or adverse events is very uncertain. Most analyses were underpowered, and all trials were conducted in low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries.",

The review included six randomized controlled trials and found that vitamin D supplementation was associated with a reduced risk of treatment failure by 21%.\nAnother study published in the Journal of Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society in 2019 found that vitamin D supplementation in children with community-acquired pneumonia was associated with a shorter duration of fever and shorter hospital stay.\nHowever, it's important to note that not all studies have found a benefit from vitamin D supplementation in treating acute childhood pneumonia. A 2020 Cochrane review found that the evidence for vitamin D supplementation in children with pneumonia was limited and that more research was needed to determine its effectiveness.\nIt's also important to note that vitamin D supplementation should not be used as a replacement for antibiotics, but rather as an adjunct to antibiotic treatment. Antibiotics are still the primary treatment for bacterial pneumonia, and vitamin D supplementation may help to enhance the effectiveness of antibiotics.\nIn summary, some studies suggest that vitamin D supplementation may have beneficial effects when used as an adjunct to antibiotics for treating acute childhood pneumonia, but more research is needed to confirm these findings and establish the optimal dosage and duration of supplementation. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional before giving vitamin D supplements to children with pneumonia.",

Compared to usual care, ultrafiltration has been shown to improve symptoms and reduce the risk of complications in some people with acute heart failure.\nOne study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that ultrafiltration significantly reduced the risk of death or hospitalization for people with acute heart failure compared to usual care. The study included 188 patients who were randomly assigned to receive either ultrafiltration or usual care. The results showed that 46% of patients in the usual care group died or were hospitalized within 60 days, compared to 25% of patients in the ultrafiltration group.\nAnother study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology found that ultrafiltration improved symptoms and reduced the amount of fluid in the body in people with acute heart failure. The study included 30 patients who received ultrafiltration and were compared to 30 patients who received usual care. The results showed that patients who received ultrafiltration had a greater improvement in symptoms and a greater reduction in fluid levels compared to patients who received usual care.\nHowever, it's important to note that ultrafiltration is not suitable for everyone with acute heart failure, and the decision to use this treatment should be made on a case-by-case basis with the guidance of a healthcare professional. Additionally, ultrafiltration is not a substitute for other treatments that are commonly used for acute heart failure, such as medications, oxygen therapy, and mechanical support.\nIn summary, ultrafiltration has been shown to improve symptoms and reduce the risk of complications in some people with acute heart failure, but it's not suitable for everyone and should be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional.",

The study found that infants treated with nusinersen had a significantly higher rate of survival and improvement in motor function compared to those who received the sham procedure.\nAt the age of 24 months, 80% of infants treated with nusinersen were alive and had achieved a motor milestone of sitting without support, compared to 8% of infants who received the sham procedure.

As the evidence is of very low certainty, no conclusions can be drawn regarding the benefits or harms of this treatment. The reported benefit of ER methylphenidate on ADHD symptoms, measured on rating scales reported by participants, investigators, and peers, was small to moderate when compared with placebo, but the evidence is very uncertain. The treatment may also have resulted in a small improvement in quality of life. Little to no effect was reported for days missed at work, school, or training. Regarding adverse events, more people receiving ER methylphenidate experienced decreased appetite (214 vs 53 per 1000 people, all results on average), dry mouth (129 vs 38 per 1000 people), headache (224 vs 167 per 1000 people), palpitations (29 vs 8 per 1000 people), insomnia (41 vs 21 per 1000 people), sexual dysfunction (13 vs 5 per 1000 people), anxiety (26 vs 11 per 1000 people), feeling jittery (63 vs 11 per 1000 people), agitation (14 vs 6 per 1000 people), aggression (116 vs 55 per 1000 people), and psychiatric adverse events (319 vs 175 per 1000 people); this led to higher rates of withdrawal in the ER methylphenidate group (60 vs 26 per 1000 people).

            "gold_answer": "When compared with placebo, ER methylphenidate may improve ADHD symptoms and quality of life, but may also increase rates of adverse events. As the evidence is of very low certainty, no conclusions can be drawn regarding the benefits or harms of this treatment. The reported benefit of ER methylphenidate on ADHD symptoms, measured on rating scales reported by participants, investigators, and peers, was small to moderate when compared with placebo, but the evidence is very uncertain. The treatment may also have resulted in a small improvement in quality of life. Little to no effect was reported for days missed at work, school, or training. Regarding adverse events, more people receiving ER methylphenidate experienced decreased appetite (214 vs 53 per 1000 people, all results on average), dry mouth (129 vs 38 per 1000 people), headache (224 vs 167 per 1000 people), palpitations (29 vs 8 per 1000 people), insomnia (41 vs 21 per 1000 people), sexual dysfunction (13 vs 5 per 1000 people), anxiety (26 vs 11 per 1000 people), feeling jittery (63 vs 11 per 1000 people), agitation (14 vs 6 per 1000 people), aggression (116 vs 55 per 1000 people), and psychiatric adverse events (319 vs 175 per 1000 people); this led to higher rates of withdrawal in the ER methylphenidate group (60 vs 26 per 1000 people). However, there was little to no difference between groups for any serious adverse events or for depression or irritability. The evidence was of very low certainty for all outcomes assessed.",

            "gold_answer": "Dopamine agonists (most often cabergoline or quinagolide; alone or as adjuvants) may reduce the risk of OHSS in women undergoing ART therapy. Effects on other outcomes are less clear. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that dopamine agonists (primarily cabergoline or quinagolide) probably reduce the incidence of moderate or severe OHSS (on average, 86 vs 226 per 1000 women). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests little to no difference between groups in rates of live birth and clinical pregnancy, although results show some imprecision. Results for multiple pregnancy and miscarriage are very imprecise and for adverse events are very uncertain. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that cabergoline may also reduce the incidence of moderate or severe OHSS when added to a co\u2010intervention (stop receiving human menopausal gonadotropin [hMG] for 1 to 3 days; receive preventive IV human albumin 20 g on day of oocyte retrieval; or receive slow IV infusion of 500 mL of 6% hydroxyethyl starch during follicle aspiration): on average, 46 vs 90 per 1000 women experienced moderate or severe OHSS.

Dopamine agonists, such as cabergoline, work by reducing the release of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which are hormones that stimulate ovulation and are often elevated in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). By reducing the levels of these hormones, dopamine agonists can help prevent OHSS, a potentially life-threatening complication of ART that is characterized by excessive ovarian stimulation and fluid buildup in the abdomen. Additionally, dopamine agonists have been shown to improve pregnancy rates and reduce the risk of miscarriage in women undergoing ART.

            "gold_answer": "Dopamine agonists (most often cabergoline or quinagolide; alone or as adjuvants) may reduce the risk of OHSS in women undergoing ART therapy. Effects on other outcomes are less clear. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that dopamine agonists (primarily cabergoline or quinagolide) probably reduce the incidence of moderate or severe OHSS (on average, 86 vs 226 per 1000 women). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests little to no difference between groups in rates of live birth and clinical pregnancy, although results show some imprecision. Results for multiple pregnancy and miscarriage are very imprecise and for adverse events are very uncertain. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that cabergoline may also reduce the incidence of moderate or severe OHSS when added to a co\u2010intervention (stop receiving human menopausal gonadotropin [hMG] for 1 to 3 days; receive preventive IV human albumin 20 g on day of oocyte retrieval; or receive slow IV infusion of 500 mL of 6% hydroxyethyl starch during follicle aspiration): on average, 46 vs 90 per 1000 women experienced moderate or severe OHSS. Results for other outcomes are imprecise.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "ADJUVANT (adjuvant): helpful, assisting, aiding, supportive\nRISK (risk): The chance that an activity or hazard will give rise to harm. Risk is generally given in terms of numerical odds (1 in 10) or percentages (10%).\nOHSS (ohss): A potentially serious complication of fertility treatment, particularly of IVF. Symptoms are abdominal swelling or bloating, nausea and vomiting.\nART (art): A combination of drugs used to treat people with HIV. It works by blocking the action of the virus and the progress of the infection.\nCLINICAL (clinical): pertaining to medical care\nMISCARRIAGE (miscarriage): The unplanned ending of a pregnancy before 23 completed weeks.\nMENOPAUSE (menopause): The time when a woman\u2019s periods stop, usually around 50 years of age. See also menstrual cycle.\nIV (iv): through the vein\nINFUSION (infusion): slow injection of a substance into the body, usually into the blood by means of a catheter\nFOLLICLE (follicle): The part of the ovary where the egg develops.\nASPIRATION (aspiration): fluid entering the lungs, such as after vomiting",

            "llm_answer": "Dopamine agonists have been used to prevent or treat ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) in women undergoing assisted reproductive technology (ART) therapy. OHSS is a potentially life-threatening complication of ART that occurs when the ovaries become overstimulated and produce excessive amounts of hormones, leading to fluid buildup in the abdomen and chest.\nStudies have shown that dopamine agonists can help reduce the risk of OHSS and improve pregnancy outcomes in women undergoing ART. Dopamine agonists work by suppressing the production of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), which are hormones that stimulate ovulation and are often elevated in women with OHSS. By reducing the levels of these hormones, dopamine agonists can help prevent or reduce the severity of OHSS.\nOne study published in the Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics found that the use of dopamine agonists in women undergoing ART reduced the incidence of OHSS from 28% to 8%. Another study published in Fertility and Sterility found that the use of dopamine agonists improved pregnancy rates in women undergoing ART, with a live birth rate of 44.4% in the dopamine agonist group compared to 27.8% in the control group.\nHowever, it's important to note that dopamine agonists are not without risks. They can cause side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and dizziness, and may also increase the risk of miscarriage. Additionally, the long-term effects of dopamine agonists on fertility and pregnancy outcomes are not well understood.\nIn summary, dopamine agonists can be effective in reducing the risk of OHSS and improving pregnancy outcomes in women undergoing ART, but their use should be carefully considered and monitored by a healthcare provider due to potential risks and side effects.",

While some studies suggest that macrolides may improve lung function and reduce symptoms in people with chronic asthma, the evidence is not strong enough to support their widespread use for this condition.\nA 2019 systematic review and meta-analysis published in the Journal of Asthma found that macrolides were associated with a small but statistically significant improvement in lung function (measured by forced expiratory volume in 1 second, or FEV1) compared to placebo in people with chronic asthma. However, the review also noted that the quality of the evidence was generally low and that the results should be interpreted with caution.\nMore recent studies have also suggested that macrolides may have a beneficial effect on asthma symptoms and lung function, but the results are not consistent across all studies. For example, a 2020 randomized controlled trial published in the European Respiratory Journal found that azithromycin improved lung function and reduced symptoms in people with severe asthma, but the study was small and the results may not be generalizable to all patients with chronic asthma.\nIt's important to note that macrolides are not without side effects, and long-term use of these medications can lead to antibiotic resistance and other adverse events. Therefore, the benefits and risks of using macrolides for chronic asthma should be carefully weighed on a case-by-case basis.\nIn summary, while some studies suggest that macrolides may be beneficial for people with chronic asthma, the evidence is not strong enough to support their widespread use for this condition. It's important to discuss the potential benefits and risks of macrolides with a healthcare provider to determine whether they are appropriate for an individual patient.",

Some of the economic tools used include:\n1. Taxes: Many countries have imposed taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages to increase their price and discourage consumption. Studies have shown that a 10% to 20% tax on these beverages can lead to a reduction in consumption of up to 20%.\n2. Subsidies: Governments have also provided subsidies to producers of healthier beverages, such as fruit and vegetable juices, to make them more affordable and attractive to consumers.\n3. Price controls: Some governments have implemented price controls to limit the price of sugar-sweetened beverages, making them less affordable and less accessible to consumers.\n4. Trade policies: Governments have also used trade policies to limit the importation of sugar-sweetened beverages or to promote the export of healthier beverages.\n5. Education and awareness campaigns: Governments and health organizations have also implemented education and awareness campaigns to inform consumers about the negative health effects of sugar-sweetened beverages and promote healthier choices.\nOverall, the impact of economic tools on the consumption and sales of sugar-sweetened beverages has been mixed. While some studies have shown a reduction in consumption, others have found that consumers may substitute sugary drinks with other unhealthy products. It is important to note that economic tools should be used in conjunction with other interventions, such as education and awareness campaigns, to promote healthier choices and reduce the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages.",

Moderate\u2010quality evidence showed that this benefit was not sustained in the longer\u2010term (5 years).

Studies have consistently demonstrated that corticosteroids reduce the risk of death and disability in patients with tuberculous meningitis, particularly in those with severe disease. The use of corticosteroids has been associated with a significant reduction in mortality rates, from approximately 30-40% in untreated patients to around 10-20% in patients receiving corticosteroids. Additionally, corticosteroids have been shown to reduce the risk of long-term disability, such as hearing loss and cognitive impairment. However, the optimal dosage and duration of corticosteroid therapy for tuberculous meningitis are still uncertain and require further research.",

Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that can help maintain a healthy gut microbiome, which is important for the development and function of various bodily systems, including the immune system.\nStudies have found that probiotics can help reduce the risk of preterm birth, which is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Probiotics have also been shown to reduce the risk of other complications in preterm infants, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious condition that can cause damage to the intestines.\nIt's important to note that not all probiotics are the same, and some strains have been found to be more effective than others in preventing morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. For example, the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any supplements during pregnancy, including probiotics, to ensure safety and effectiveness. Additionally, it's important to note that while probiotics can help reduce the risk of complications, they are not a guarantee against them, and other factors such as proper prenatal care, a healthy diet, and a safe delivery are also important for a healthy pregnancy and baby.",
