            "gold_answer": "No evidence suggests that PBI is superior to WBRT for women with early breast cancer. For women with early breast cancer, five\u2010year overall survival (high\u2010certainty evidence), cause\u2010specific survival (moderate\u2010certainty evidence), distant metastasis\u2013free survival (moderate\u2010certainty evidence), and local recurrence\u2013free survival (low\u2010certainty evidence) differed little in absolute terms between PBI and WBRT. Evidence shows that relapse\u2010free survival (moderate\u2010certainty evidence) and locoregional recurrence\u2013free survival (low\u2010certainty evidence) were worse with PBI than with WBRT (29 more breast cancer relapses and 9 more locoregional recurrences per 1000 women with PBI; all results on average). However, rates of survival at five years were high in all groups. Evidence shows little to no difference between groups in mastectomy rates (high certainty), but more women probably have poor physician\u2010reported cosmesis with PBI (moderate certainty; 227 vs 158 with per 1000 women). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that new primary tumors in the ipsilateral breast may appear more frequently with PBI (21 vs 8 per 1000 women). Acute radiation skin toxicity probably is less common with PBI (253 vs 308 per 1000 women; moderate\u2010certainty evidence), but late skin toxicity may be increased with PBI (54 vs 24 per 1000 women; low\u2010certainty evidence).

However, PBI has several advantages over WBRT, including:\n1. Reduced risk of side effects: PBI can reduce the risk of side effects such as skin burns, fatigue, and damage to healthy tissue in the breast.\n2. Shorter treatment time: PBI typically requires fewer treatment sessions than WBRT, which can reduce the overall treatment time and improve patient convenience.\n3. Better cosmetic outcomes: PBI can result in better cosmetic outcomes, as it avoids the unnecessary radiation exposure to the entire breast.\nHowever, PBI may not be suitable for all women with early breast cancer, and the decision to undergo PBI or WBRT should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account factors such as the size and location of the tumor, the patient's age and overall health, and the risk of recurrence.\nIt's important to note that both PBI and WBRT are effective treatments for early breast cancer, and the choice between them should be made in consultation with a radiation oncologist, who can assess the individual patient's needs and provide personalized recommendations.",

Digital interventions can include a variety of tools and strategies, such as mobile apps, text messaging, and telemedicine, that help patients manage their asthma and adhere to their treatment plans.\nStudies have shown that digital interventions can improve asthma control by providing patients with personalized information and reminders, tracking medication use and symptoms, and facilitating communication with healthcare providers. For example, a study published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology found that patients who used a mobile app to track their asthma symptoms and medication use had better asthma control and reduced hospitalizations compared to those who did not use the app.\nAdditionally, digital interventions can improve adherence to maintenance treatments by providing patients with reminders and alerts to take their medication, and by making it easier for patients to communicate with their healthcare providers. A study published in the Journal of Asthma found that patients who received text message reminders to take their asthma medication had higher adherence rates compared to those who did not receive reminders.\nOverall, digital interventions have the potential to improve asthma control and adherence to maintenance treatments for people with asthma, and may be a useful addition to traditional asthma management strategies. However, it's important to note that digital interventions should be tailored to the individual patient's needs and should be used in conjunction with other asthma management strategies, such as medication and lifestyle changes.",

            "gold_answer": "In comparison with usual care, no treatment, or minimal treatment, psychological therapies may improve depression, anxiety, and post\u2010traumatic stress disorder symptoms in the short term for women who have experienced IPV. For women who have experienced IPV, psychological therapies appear to result in a small improvement in depression symptoms in the short term (6 months, 15 RCTs; 1247 participants) and in the medium term (6 to 12 months; moderate\u2010certainty evidence) but not at long\u2010term follow\u2010up (3 RCTs, 503 participants). A clinically important improvement in anxiety symptoms may be seen in the short term following psychological therapies (low\u2010certainty evidence) but not in the long term (1 RCT, 166 participants). Psychological therapies may also slightly reduce post\u2010traumatic stress disorder at short term (9 RCTs, 1150 participants) but not at medium (low\u2010certainty evidence) or long term (1 RCT, 170 participants). Psychological therapies appear to be no better or worse than control for self\u2010efficacy, withdrawal from treatment, quality of life, safety planning behavior, or incidents of re\u2010exposure at short, medium, or long term.",

For women who have experienced IPV, psychological therapies appear to result in a small improvement in depression symptoms in the short term (6 months, 15 RCTs; 1247 participants) and in the medium term (6 to 12 months; moderate\u2010certainty evidence) but not at long\u2010term follow\u2010up (3 RCTs, 503 participants). A clinically important improvement in anxiety symptoms may be seen in the short term following psychological therapies (low\u2010certainty evidence) but not in the long term (1 RCT, 166 participants). Psychological therapies may also slightly reduce post\u2010traumatic stress disorder at short term (9 RCTs, 1150 participants) but not at medium (low\u2010certainty evidence) or long term (1 RCT, 170 participants). Psychological therapies appear to be no better or worse than control for self\u2010efficacy, withdrawal from treatment, quality of life, safety planning behavior, or incidents of re\u2010exposure at short, medium, or long term.",

Emotional support: Therapy can provide a safe and confidential space for women to share their experiences and emotions, and receive support and validation from a trained professional.\n2. Coping strategies: Therapy can help women develop coping strategies and techniques to manage their emotions, anxiety, and stress related to IPV.\n3. Empowerment: Therapy can empower women to regain control over their lives, set boundaries, and make informed decisions about their relationships.\n4. Trauma recovery: Therapy can help women recover from trauma and improve their mental health and well-being.\n5. Prevention of further abuse: Therapy can help women develop strategies to prevent further abuse and create a safety plan.\nHowever, it's important to note that therapy may not be suitable for everyone, and there are potential harms to consider:\nHarms:\n1. Retraumatization: Women may experience distress or discomfort when discussing their experiences, which can be retraumatizing.\n2. Dependence on the therapist: Women may become too dependent on the therapist, which can create difficulties when the therapy ends.\n3. Lack of cultural sensitivity: Therapy may not be culturally sensitive, which can create a barrier for women from diverse backgrounds.\n4. Cost: Therapy can be expensive, which may not be accessible for all women.\n5. Stigma: Women may experience stigma or shame when seeking therapy for IPV.\nIt's crucial to ensure that therapy is tailored to the individual's needs, takes into account their cultural background, and is provided by a trained and experienced professional. Additionally, therapy should be accompanied by other support services, such as legal aid, housing assistance, and medical care, to provide comprehensive support for women experiencing IPV.",

Some studies suggest that glucocorticoids may help reduce inflammation and improve the implantation of the embryo in the uterus, potentially leading to higher pregnancy rates and reduced risk of complications such as pregnancy-related hypertension and preeclampsia. However, the evidence is not yet conclusive, and more research is needed to fully understand the effects of peri-implantation glucocorticoid administration in women undergoing ART.\nIt's important to note that glucocorticoids can have potential side effects, particularly when used in high doses or for extended periods. These may include weight gain, mood changes, and increased risk of infections. Therefore, it's important to discuss the potential benefits and risks of peri-implantation glucocorticoid administration with a healthcare provider to determine if it's appropriate for an individual's specific situation. Additionally, it's essential to follow the recommended dosage and administration guidelines to minimize potential risks.",

When a composite reference standard was used (latent class analysis) for the diagnosis of rectocele, pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity were 98% and 78% for EP, 94% and 90% for MRI, and 88% and 89% for TPUS, respectively. Based on these estimates and a prevalence of 59%, the number of women wrongly diagnosed with rectocele for every 1000 women tested would be 91 with EP, 40 with MRI, and 45 with TPUS. The number of women with rectocele missed would be 15 with EP, 34 with MRI, and 68 with TPUS. Using the pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity and a pretest probability of 59%, high\u2010 to moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows the probability of an accurate rectocele diagnosis after a positive test would be approximately 80% with EP and approximately 90% with MRI and TPUS.

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers reported on the accuracy of EP, MRI and TPUS for the detection of rectocele in women with ODS. When a composite reference standard was used (latent class analysis) for the diagnosis of rectocele, pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity were 98% and 78% for EP, 94% and 90% for MRI, and 88% and 89% for TPUS, respectively. Based on these estimates and a prevalence of 59%, the number of women wrongly diagnosed with rectocele for every 1000 women tested would be 91 with EP, 40 with MRI, and 45 with TPUS. The number of women with rectocele missed would be 15 with EP, 34 with MRI, and 68 with TPUS. Using the pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity and a pretest probability of 59%, high\u2010 to moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows the probability of an accurate rectocele diagnosis after a positive test would be approximately 80% with EP and approximately 90% with MRI and TPUS. After a negative test, the probability would be 4%, 7%, and 15%, respectively.",

However, it's important to note that the accuracy of these tests can vary depending on the population studied, the test protocols used, and the expertise of the healthcare providers interpreting the results.\nThat being said, here are some general findings from the available literature:\n1. Evacuation Proctography (EP):\nEP is a non-invasive test that measures the movement of the rectum and anus during defecation. Studies have shown that EP has a sensitivity of 70-80% and a specificity of 80-90% for the detection of rectocele in women with ODS (1,2). However, EP may not be able to diagnose rectocele in all patients, especially those with mild or occult forms of the condition (3).\n2. Dynamic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI):\nMRI is a non-invasive imaging modality that can provide detailed information about the rectal and pelvic floor anatomy. Studies have reported that dynamic MRI has a sensitivity of 80-90% and a specificity of 80-90% for the detection of rectocele in women with ODS (4,5). However, MRI may not be able to diagnose rectocele in all patients, especially those with mild or occult forms of the condition (6).\n3. Transperineal Ultrasound (TPUS):\nTPUS is a non-invasive imaging modality that uses sound waves to visualize the rectal and pelvic floor structures. Studies have shown that TPUS has a sensitivity of 70-80% and a specificity of 80-90% for the detection of rectocele in women with ODS (7,8). However, TPUS may not be able to diagnose rectocele in all patients, especially those with mild or occult forms of the condition (9",

Evidence from two RCTs shows that early treatment may lead to development of oliguria in more infants than occurs with expectant management, although rates in both groups were very low. RCT evidence shows no clear differences in all other outcomes, including all\u2010cause in\u2010hospital mortality and chronic lung disease (moderate\u2010certainty evidence), grades III and IV intraventricular hemorrhage and necrotizing enterocolitis (Bell's stage 2 or greater; low\u2010certainty evidence), and need for surgical PDA ligation or transcatheter occlusion (very low\u2010certainty evidence), as well as duration of ventilator support and supplementary oxygen (1 RCT with 127 infants). No studies assessed neurodevelopmental outcomes.",

These include:\n* Reduced risk of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC)\n* Lower incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)\n* Improved survival rates\n* Shorter duration of mechanical ventilation and hospital stay\n* Lower risk of pulmonary hemorrhage\n* Fewer cases of pulmonary dysplasia\nEarly treatment options for PDA include medications such as indomethacin or ibuprofen, which can help close the ductus arteriosus, and surgical ligation. Expectant management, on the other hand, involves monitoring the infant's condition closely and delaying treatment until the ductus arteriosus closes spontaneously or the infant's condition worsens.\nIt's important to note that the decision to treat PDA early or manage it expectantly should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the infant's gestational age, birth weight, and overall health status.

Evidence from two RCTs shows that early treatment may lead to development of oliguria in more infants than occurs with expectant management, although rates in both groups were very low. RCT evidence shows no clear differences in all other outcomes, including all\u2010cause in\u2010hospital mortality and chronic lung disease (moderate\u2010certainty evidence), grades III and IV intraventricular hemorrhage and necrotizing enterocolitis (Bell's stage 2 or greater; low\u2010certainty evidence), and need for surgical PDA ligation or transcatheter occlusion (very low\u2010certainty evidence), as well as duration of ventilator support and supplementary oxygen (1 RCT with 127 infants). No studies assessed neurodevelopmental outcomes.",

            "llm_answer": "Early treatment (within 7 days) of hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm infants has been shown to have several advantages compared to expectant management.\nEarly treatment has been associated with:\n1. Reduced risk of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC): NEC is a serious complication that can occur in preterm infants, and early treatment of PDA has been shown to reduce the risk of developing NEC.\n2. Improved respiratory outcomes: Early treatment of PDA can help improve respiratory function and reduce the need for oxygen therapy in preterm infants.\n3. Reduced risk of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH): IVH is a type of bleeding in the brain that can occur in preterm infants, and early treatment of PDA has been shown to reduce the risk of IVH.\n4. Faster closure of the ductus arteriosus: Early treatment of PDA can help promote faster closure of the ductus arteriosus, which can reduce the risk of complications associated with a patent ductus arteriosus.\n5. Shorter hospital stay: Early treatment of PDA can help reduce the length of hospital stay for preterm infants.\nIt's important to note that expectant management of PDA in preterm infants may be appropriate in some cases, such as when the ductus arteriosus is small and not causing any significant cardiovascular problems. However, in cases where the PDA is hemodynamically significant, early treatment is generally recommended.\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the best course of treatment for each individual case.",

            "gold_answer": "For adults with oral cavity cancer, oropharyngeal cancer, or both, probably fewer people die with platinum\u2010containing compounds + 5\u2010fluorouracil (5\u2010FU) + radiotherapy (RT) than RT alone, and fewer people may die with cisplatin + 5\u2010FU + concurrent chemoradiation treatment (CRT) with cisplatin than CRT with cisplatin alone. Probably fewer people die with surgery + CRT than with surgery + RT, or with concurrent CRT compared to RT alone. For adults with oral cavity cancer, oropharyngeal cancer, or both, moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that probably fewer people at low, moderate, or high risk of death die with platinum\u2010containing compounds + 5\u2010FU + RT than RT alone (173 vs 200, 445 vs 500, and 641 vs 700 per 1000 people, respectively; all results on average), but this result did not reach statistical significance. Low\u2010certainty suggests that fewer people at moderate risk of death may die with cisplatin + 5\u2010FU + CRT with cisplatin than CRT with cisplatin alone (389 vs 500 per 1000 people), but this result did not reach statistical significance, and there may be minimal to no important difference for cisplatin + 5\u2010FU + surgery compared with surgery alone, and for cisplatin + 5\u2010FU + docetaxel + CRT with cisplatin compared with CRT with cisplatin alone. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that probably fewer people at low, moderate, or high risk of death die with surgery + CRT than with surgery + RT (171 vs 200, 441 vs 500, and 636 vs 700 per 1000 people, respectively); however, there is probably minimal to no important difference between adjuvant chemotherapy and observation. There may be better overall survival with adjuvant CRT with cisplatin than with RT, and better disease\u2010free survival with adjuvant CRT with cisplatin than with RT alone. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that probably fewer people at low, moderate, or high risk of death die with concurrent CRT than with RT alone (156 vs 200, 410 vs 500, and 599 vs 700 per 1000 people, respectively). There may be better overall survival with concurrent CRT (platinum\u2010containing compounds alone, platinum\u2010containing compounds + 5\u2010FU, or 5\u2010FU + mitomycin C) than with RT alone (based on 384 to 1154 participants), and also better disease\u2010free survival with concurrent CRT (platinum\u2010containing compounds + 5\u2010FU; 5\u2010FU + mitomycin C; methotrexate; bleomycin + mitomycin C; or 5\u2010FU + bleomycin + methotrexate + vincristine) than with RT alone (based on 64 to 966 participants).

            "gold_answer": "For adults with oral cavity cancer, oropharyngeal cancer, or both, probably fewer people die with platinum\u2010containing compounds + 5\u2010fluorouracil (5\u2010FU) + radiotherapy (RT) than RT alone, and fewer people may die with cisplatin + 5\u2010FU + concurrent chemoradiation treatment (CRT) with cisplatin than CRT with cisplatin alone. Probably fewer people die with surgery + CRT than with surgery + RT, or with concurrent CRT compared to RT alone. For adults with oral cavity cancer, oropharyngeal cancer, or both, moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that probably fewer people at low, moderate, or high risk of death die with platinum\u2010containing compounds + 5\u2010FU + RT than RT alone (173 vs 200, 445 vs 500, and 641 vs 700 per 1000 people, respectively; all results on average), but this result did not reach statistical significance. Low\u2010certainty suggests that fewer people at moderate risk of death may die with cisplatin + 5\u2010FU + CRT with cisplatin than CRT with cisplatin alone (389 vs 500 per 1000 people), but this result did not reach statistical significance, and there may be minimal to no important difference for cisplatin + 5\u2010FU + surgery compared with surgery alone, and for cisplatin + 5\u2010FU + docetaxel + CRT with cisplatin compared with CRT with cisplatin alone. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that probably fewer people at low, moderate, or high risk of death die with surgery + CRT than with surgery + RT (171 vs 200, 441 vs 500, and 636 vs 700 per 1000 people, respectively); however, there is probably minimal to no important difference between adjuvant chemotherapy and observation. There may be better overall survival with adjuvant CRT with cisplatin than with RT, and better disease\u2010free survival with adjuvant CRT with cisplatin than with RT alone. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that probably fewer people at low, moderate, or high risk of death die with concurrent CRT than with RT alone (156 vs 200, 410 vs 500, and 599 vs 700 per 1000 people, respectively). There may be better overall survival with concurrent CRT (platinum\u2010containing compounds alone, platinum\u2010containing compounds + 5\u2010FU, or 5\u2010FU + mitomycin C) than with RT alone (based on 384 to 1154 participants), and also better disease\u2010free survival with concurrent CRT (platinum\u2010containing compounds + 5\u2010FU; 5\u2010FU + mitomycin C; methotrexate; bleomycin + mitomycin C; or 5\u2010FU + bleomycin + methotrexate + vincristine) than with RT alone (based on 64 to 966 participants). Reviewers did not evaluate quality of life or adverse events for any comparison.",

However, some common effects of chemotherapy for oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer include:\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Fatigue\n* Mouth sores (mucositis)\n* Hair loss (alopecia)\n* Increased risk of infection\n* Diarrhea\n* Nerve damage (neuropathy)\n* Changes in taste and appetite\n* Weight loss\nIt's important to note that not all patients will experience these side effects, and the severity of the side effects can vary depending on the specific chemotherapy drugs used, the dose, and the patient's overall health.\nIn addition to these side effects, chemotherapy can also have long-term effects on oral health, such as dry mouth, tooth decay, and jaw bone damage.\nIt's important to note that chemotherapy is not always necessary for oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer, and the decision to use it will depend on the stage and location of the cancer, as well as other individual factors. Your oncologist will be able to advise you on the best course of treatment for your specific case.\nIt's also important to note that there are different types of chemotherapy, and the choice of chemotherapy will depend on the specific type of cancer, the stage, and other individual factors.\nIt's important to discuss any concerns or questions you have with your oncologist, they will be able to provide you with more information and guidance on what to expect during and after treatment.",

Moderate\u2010certainty evidence from eight RCTs at low risk for selection bias and \u2018other\u2019 bias suggested an unclear effect of endometrial injury on live birth in women undergoing ART. Endometrial injury was most commonly performed during the follicular or luteal phase, prior to ART, using a pipelle. The result slightly favored endometrial injury but did not reach statistical significance. Reviewers found little to no difference in clinical pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate or multiple pregnancy rate. Most women reported mild to moderate pain after endometrial injury. When the reviewers included all the RCTs and compared endometrial injury with no procedure or a sham procedure, results were inconclusive for live birth (29 RCTs; 7792 women) and for clinical pregnancy (37 RCTs; 8786 women), but the evidence was of very low certainty. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests little to no difference in miscarriage rates. Multiple pregnancy rates were higher with endometrial injury than with no intervention or placebo (on average, 23 vs 18 per 1000 women; 20 RCTs with 5978 participants; certainty of evidence not assessed).",

The exact mechanism by which endometrial injury improves outcomes is not fully understood, but it is thought to increase the expression of certain genes and proteins that promote embryo implantation and reduce inflammation in the uterus.\nHowever, it's important to note that endometrial injury is not a standard procedure for all women undergoing ART, and its use is still a topic of debate among fertility specialists. Some studies have shown that endometrial injury may not improve outcomes for all women, and it may only be beneficial for certain subgroups of patients, such as those with a history of recurrent implantation failure or those with a thin endometrium.\nIt's also important to note that endometrial injury carries some risks, such as bleeding, infection, and uterine damage, although these risks are generally low.\nIn summary, while some studies suggest that endometrial injury may improve outcomes for women undergoing ART, its use is not yet widely adopted and its effectiveness is still being studied.

            "gold_answer": "Low\u2010certainty evidence from RCTs including around 1500 infants, most of whom were very preterm (27 to 36 weeks) or very low birth weight (\u2264 1250 to 2000 g), suggests that delaying the introduction of feeds beyond four days after birth does not decrease the risk of developing necrotizing enterocolitis or reduce mortality prior to discharge from hospital. Based on moderate\u2010 to low\u2010certainty evidence, more infants had invasive infection with delayed than with early introduction of feeds (388 vs 270 per 1000 infants; all results on average), but fewer infants had feed intolerance with delayed than with early introduction of feeds (416 vs 511 per 1000 infants). Limited evidence from studies involving a total of 478 infants suggests that there may be no difference in growth between delayed and early feed introduction. Delaying the introduction of progressive enteral feeds increased the time taken to reach full feeds by 2 to 5.5 days; however, it is unclear what effect this has on infant outcomes. Data were insufficient to determine the effects of delayed versus early introduction of feeds in subgroups such as mostly formula fed, mostly human milk fed, and extremely preterm/low birth weight infants. No trial assessed long\u2010term growth parameters or neurodevelopmental outcomes.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "RCT (rct): A study which tests the effectiveness and safety of treatments or procedures as fairly and objectively as possible. By randomly assigning patients to different treatments for the same problem, the results can be assessed equally with the aim of discovering the best possible procedure for the condition.\nRISK (risk): The chance that an activity or hazard will give rise to harm. Risk is generally given in terms of numerical odds (1 in 10) or percentages (10%).\nMORTALITY (mortality): death\nINVASIVE (invasive): A medical procedure when a cut is made to the body or an instrument is inserted.\nASSESS (assess): to learn about, measure, evaluate, look at",

            "gold_answer": "Low\u2010certainty evidence from RCTs including around 1500 infants, most of whom were very preterm (27 to 36 weeks) or very low birth weight (\u2264 1250 to 2000 g), suggests that delaying the introduction of feeds beyond four days after birth does not decrease the risk of developing necrotizing enterocolitis or reduce mortality prior to discharge from hospital. Based on moderate\u2010 to low\u2010certainty evidence, more infants had invasive infection with delayed than with early introduction of feeds (388 vs 270 per 1000 infants; all results on average), but fewer infants had feed intolerance with delayed than with early introduction of feeds (416 vs 511 per 1000 infants). Limited evidence from studies involving a total of 478 infants suggests that there may be no difference in growth between delayed and early feed introduction. Delaying the introduction of progressive enteral feeds increased the time taken to reach full feeds by 2 to 5.5 days; however, it is unclear what effect this has on infant outcomes. Data were insufficient to determine the effects of delayed versus early introduction of feeds in subgroups such as mostly formula fed, mostly human milk fed, and extremely preterm/low birth weight infants. No trial assessed long\u2010term growth parameters or neurodevelopmental outcomes.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "RCT (rct): A study which tests the effectiveness and safety of treatments or procedures as fairly and objectively as possible. By randomly assigning patients to different treatments for the same problem, the results can be assessed equally with the aim of discovering the best possible procedure for the condition.\nRISK (risk): The chance that an activity or hazard will give rise to harm. Risk is generally given in terms of numerical odds (1 in 10) or percentages (10%).\nMORTALITY (mortality): death\nINVASIVE (invasive): A medical procedure when a cut is made to the body or an instrument is inserted.\nASSESS (assess): to learn about, measure, evaluate, look at",

            "llm_answer": "Delaying the introduction of progressive enteral feeds in very preterm or very low birth weight infants can have both positive and negative effects on their outcomes.\nPositive effects:\n1. Reduced risk of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC): NEC is a serious intestinal condition that can occur in premature infants who receive enteral feeds too early. Delaying the introduction of progressive enteral feeds can reduce the risk of NEC, as the gut is given more time to mature and develop.\n2. Improved gut maturation: Delaying enteral feeds allows the gut to mature and develop further, which can lead to better digestion and absorption of nutrients, and a lower risk of gut-related complications.\n3. Reduced risk of sepsis: Delaying enteral feeds can reduce the risk of sepsis, as the gut is less likely to be colonized with harmful bacteria that can cause sepsis.\nNegative effects:\n1. Delayed nutrition: Delaying the introduction of progressive enteral feeds can result in delayed nutrition, which can negatively impact the infant's growth and development.\n2. Increased risk of feeding intolerance: Delaying enteral feeds can increase the risk of feeding intolerance, as the infant may have difficulty adjusting to feeding once enteral feeds are introduced.\n3. Increased risk of prolonged hospital stay: Delaying enteral feeds can increase the risk of a prolonged hospital stay, as the infant may require additional time to recover and develop before being able to tolerate enteral feeds.\nIt's important to note that the optimal timing for introducing progressive enteral feeds in very preterm or very low birth weight infants is still a topic of debate and research. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the best approach for each individual infant based on their unique needs and circumstances.",

The use of corticosteroids has been associated with a significant reduction in mortality rates, from approximately 30-40% in untreated patients to around 10-20% in patients receiving corticosteroids. Additionally, corticosteroids have been shown to reduce the risk of long-term disability, such as hearing loss and cognitive impairment.

According to a systematic review and meta-analysis published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, corticosteroids reduced the risk of death and disability in patients with tuberculous meningitis by 27% and 23%, respectively, compared to those who did not receive corticosteroids. However, the review also noted that the quality of the evidence was generally low and that further research is needed to confirm these findings. It's important to note that corticosteroids should only be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional and in conjunction with appropriate antituberculous therapy.",

Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that can help maintain a healthy gut microbiome, which is important for the development and function of various bodily systems, including the immune system.\nStudies have found that probiotics can help reduce the risk of preterm birth, which is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Probiotics have also been shown to reduce the risk of other complications in preterm infants, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious condition that can cause damage to the intestines.\nIt's important to note that not all probiotics are the same, and some strains have been found to be more effective than others in preventing morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. For example, the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any supplements during pregnancy, including probiotics, to ensure safety and effectiveness. Additionally, it's important to note that while probiotics can help reduce the risk of complications, they are not a guarantee against them, and other factors such as proper prenatal care, a healthy diet, and a safe delivery are also important for a healthy pregnancy and baby.",
