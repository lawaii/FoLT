            "gold_answer": "Compared with placebo/no intervention for adults with chronic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs) had no clear impact on all\u2010cause or cardiovascular mortality (moderate\u2010 to high\u2010certainty evidence). Moderate\u2010 to high\u2010 certainty evidence also shows some differences between groups: with an MRA, fewer people were hospitalized due to heart failure (117 vs 142 per 1000 people; all values on average) but more people developed hyperkalemia (192 vs 91 per 1000 people) and withdrew due to an adverse event (346 vs 314 per 1000 people; based on 4037 participants); with an ARB, more people developed hyperkalemia (8 vs 4 per 1000 people) and more withdrew due to an adverse event (171 vs 140 per 1000 people); and with an ARNI, fewer people required hospitalization (162 vs 181 per 1000 people) and fewer people developed hyperkalemia (134 vs 153 per 1000 people).",

Reduce blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance, which can reduce the workload on the heart and improve symptoms such as shortness of breath.\n2. Improve exercise capacity and quality of life.\n3. Reduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure.\n4. Lower the risk of cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction (heart attack) and stroke.\nHowever, it's important to note that RAAS inhibitors may not be effective for all patients with HFpEF, and the benefits may vary depending on the individual patient's characteristics and comorbidities. Additionally, RAAS inhibitors can have side effects, such as cough, angioedema, and hyperkalemia, which should be carefully monitored and managed.\nIn summary, RAAS inhibitors are a useful treatment option for patients with chronic heart failure and preserved ejection fraction, but their effectiveness can vary and should be carefully evaluated on a case-by-case basis.",

Moderate\u2010 to high\u2010 certainty evidence also shows some differences between groups: with an MRA, fewer people were hospitalized due to heart failure (117 vs 142 per 1000 people; all values on average) but more people developed hyperkalemia (192 vs 91 per 1000 people) and withdrew due to an adverse event (346 vs 314 per 1000 people; based on 4037 participants); with an ARB, more people developed hyperkalemia (8 vs 4 per 1000 people) and more withdrew due to an adverse event (171 vs 140 per 1000 people); and with an ARNI, fewer people required hospitalization (162 vs 181 per 1000 people) and fewer people developed hyperkalemia (134 vs 153 per 1000 people).",

It's important to discuss the potential benefits and risks of RAAS inhibitors with a healthcare provider to determine if they are appropriate for an individual patient.\nIt's also important to note that while RAAS inhibitors have been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events and improving symptoms in people with HFpEF, they may not be effective for everyone, and other treatments may be necessary in some cases.

These advantages include:\n* Improved pregnancy rates: Freeze-all strategies have been shown to result in higher pregnancy rates compared to fresh embryo transfer, likely due to the ability to select the best embryos for transfer and reduce the risk of embryo fragmentation.\n* Reduced risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS): By freezing all embryos and transferring them in a subsequent cycle, the risk of OHSS, a potentially dangerous side effect of IVF, is reduced.\n* Reduced risk of multiple pregnancies: Freeze-all strategies can reduce the risk of multiple pregnancies, which is a common complication of IVF, by allowing for the transfer of a single embryo in a subsequent cycle.\n* Improved embryo selection: Freeze-all strategies allow for the selection of the best embryos for transfer, which can improve pregnancy rates and reduce the risk of miscarriage.\n* Increased flexibility: Freeze-all strategies allow for more flexibility in treatment planning, as embryos can be transferred in a subsequent cycle when the patient is in a better condition, or when other factors, such as the presence of a surrogate or gestational carrier, are optimal.\nOverall, a freeze-all strategy can offer several advantages over conventional IVF and fresh embryo transfer during ART, including improved pregnancy rates, reduced risk of OHSS and multiple pregnancies, improved embryo selection, and increased flexibility in treatment planning.",

Body weight may also be reduced (by 1.21 kg). Studies likely lacked power to provide reliable results on glomerular filtration rate or orthostatic hypotension. Of note, most studies were published between 1997 and 2004.",

            "llm_answer": "Lowering dietary salt intake has been shown to have several beneficial effects on preventing and slowing the progression of diabetic kidney disease. These effects include:\n1. Reduced albuminuria: High salt intake can increase albuminuria, which is a hallmark of diabetic kidney disease. Lowering salt intake can help reduce albuminuria and slow its progression.\n2. Lower blood pressure: High blood pressure is a major risk factor for diabetic kidney disease, and lowering salt intake can help reduce blood pressure and slow the progression of kidney damage.\n3. Improved kidney function: Lowering salt intake can help improve kidney function by reducing the amount of work the kidneys have to do to process excess salt.\n4. Reduced inflammation: High salt intake can increase inflammation in the body, which can contribute to the progression of diabetic kidney disease. Lowering salt intake can help reduce inflammation and slow the progression of kidney damage.\n5. Reduced risk of cardiovascular disease: Lowering salt intake can also reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, which is a common complication of diabetic kidney disease.\nOverall, lowering dietary salt intake can have a positive impact on preventing and slowing the progression of diabetic kidney disease, and it is a recommended strategy for managing the condition.",

These drugs work by inhibiting the activity of factor Xa, a clotting factor that is involved in the formation of blood clots.\nCompared to standard anticoagulation, oral factor Xa inhibitors have several advantages:\n1. Ease of use: Oral factor Xa inhibitors are given in a fixed dose, once or twice daily, and do not require frequent monitoring or dose adjustments, unlike warfarin, which requires frequent blood tests and dose adjustments.\n2. Rapid onset of action: Oral factor Xa inhibitors start working within hours of the first dose, whereas warfarin takes several days to reach full effect.\n3. Reduced risk of bleeding: Oral factor Xa inhibitors have been shown to have a lower risk of major bleeding compared to warfarin, particularly intracranial bleeding.\n4. Reduced risk of recurrent DVT and PE: Oral factor Xa inhibitors have been shown to reduce the risk of recurrent DVT and pulmonary embolism (PE) compared to standard anticoagulation.\n5. Improved patient convenience and satisfaction: Oral factor Xa inhibitors are given orally, which eliminates the need for injections and allows patients to take their medication at home.\nHowever, oral factor Xa inhibitors are not without limitations. They can be expensive, and their long-term safety and efficacy are still being studied. Additionally, they may interact with certain medications, such as certain antibiotics and anti-seizure drugs, and patients with severe renal impairment may require dose adjustments.\nIn summary, oral factor Xa inhibitors are a safe and effective alternative to standard anticoagulation for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis.

            "llm_answer": "Oral factor Xa inhibitors, such as rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, are alternative treatments to standard anticoagulation therapy, such as warfarin or heparin, for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).\nCompared to standard anticoagulation, oral factor Xa inhibitors have been shown to have several advantages in the treatment of DVT:\n1. Ease of use: Oral factor Xa inhibitors are taken as a pill once or twice a day, whereas standard anticoagulation requires frequent injections or blood tests to monitor the International Normalized Ratio (INR).\n2. Rapid onset of action: Oral factor Xa inhibitors start working within hours of the first dose, whereas standard anticoagulation can take days to reach full effect.\n3. Reduced risk of bleeding: Oral factor Xa inhibitors have been shown to have a lower risk of major bleeding compared to standard anticoagulation, particularly in the elderly population.\n4. Improved patient convenience: Oral factor Xa inhibitors do not require frequent blood tests or dietary restrictions, making them more convenient for patients.\n5. Non-inferior efficacy: Multiple clinical trials have demonstrated that oral factor Xa inhibitors are non-inferior to standard anticoagulation in preventing recurrent DVT and pulmonary embolism.\nHowever, it is important to note that oral factor Xa inhibitors are not suitable for all patients, such as those with severe renal impairment or bleeding disorders. Additionally, the cost of oral factor Xa inhibitors can be higher compared to standard anticoagulation.\nIn summary, oral factor Xa inhibitors are a safe and effective alternative to standard anticoagulation for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis, offering advantages in ease of use, rapid onset of action, reduced risk of bleeding, improved patient convenience, and non-inferior efficacy. However, the choice of treatment should be individualized based on patient factors and clinical context.",

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers found no conclusive evidence that interventions designed to improve immunosuppressant medication adherence had any significant impact on regimen adherence. The types of adherence interventions analyzed were heterogenous and included educational sessions, smartphone apps, and electronic interventions (e.g. telemedically supported case management, web\u2010based research/peer\u2010support platforms, and electronic medication dispensers), or once/day tacrolimus. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that interventions for increasing immunosuppressant medication adherence may result in more people taking the correct dosage of medication (895 vs 787 per 1000 people; all results on average). However, adherence interventions had little effect on the proportion of prescribed immunosuppressant medications taken (taking adherence) or the proportion of doses taken at the correct time (timing adherence). Adherence interventions had little to no effect on drug holidays (665 vs 595 per 1000 people). The impact of the adherence interventions on self\u2010reported adherence was unclear due to the very low certainty of the evidence. Similarly, the effect of the interventions on the proportion of immunosuppressant trough concentration levels at target was unclear. The effect of interventions for increasing immunosuppressant medication adherence on mortality when compared with standard care was uncertain, (19 vs 18 deaths per 1000 people). No RCTs assessed the impact of adherence interventions on health\u2010related quality of life; other evidence was mixed. The certainty of the evidence for all outcomes was low to very low.",

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers found no conclusive evidence that interventions designed to improve immunosuppressant medication adherence had any significant impact on regimen adherence. The types of adherence interventions analyzed were heterogenous and included educational sessions, smartphone apps, and electronic interventions (e.g. telemedically supported case management, web\u2010based research/peer\u2010support platforms, and electronic medication dispensers), or once/day tacrolimus. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that interventions for increasing immunosuppressant medication adherence may result in more people taking the correct dosage of medication (895 vs 787 per 1000 people; all results on average). However, adherence interventions had little effect on the proportion of prescribed immunosuppressant medications taken (taking adherence) or the proportion of doses taken at the correct time (timing adherence). Adherence interventions had little to no effect on drug holidays (665 vs 595 per 1000 people). The impact of the adherence interventions on self\u2010reported adherence was unclear due to the very low certainty of the evidence. Similarly, the effect of the interventions on the proportion of immunosuppressant trough concentration levels at target was unclear. The effect of interventions for increasing immunosuppressant medication adherence on mortality when compared with standard care was uncertain, (19 vs 18 deaths per 1000 people). No RCTs assessed the impact of adherence interventions on health\u2010related quality of life; other evidence was mixed. The certainty of the evidence for all outcomes was low to very low.",

These interventions may include patient education, medication reminders, and monitoring, as well as tailored interventions that address individual patient barriers to adherence.\nA systematic review and meta-analysis published in the journal Transplantation found that interventions aimed at improving medication adherence in solid organ transplant recipients resulted in a significant increase in adherence rates, ranging from 11% to 44%. The review included 22 studies that evaluated a variety of interventions, including patient education, medication reminders, and monitoring.\nAnother study published in the American Journal of Transplantation found that a tailored, patient-centered intervention that addressed individual barriers to adherence resulted in a significant improvement in medication adherence rates compared to standard care. The intervention included a personalized medication plan, medication reminders, and regular follow-up appointments.\nIt is important to note that the effectiveness of interventions may vary depending on the individual patient and the specific intervention used. It is also important to consider the potential risks and benefits of each intervention, as well as the patient's preferences and values.\nIn summary, interventions aimed at increasing immunosuppressant medication adherence in solid organ transplant recipients have been shown to be effective in improving medication adherence rates and reducing the risk of graft rejection.

However, they have some differences in terms of their mechanism of action, efficacy, and potential side effects.\nNSAIDs, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, work by blocking the production of prostaglandins, which are chemicals that cause pain and inflammation. They are typically injected directly into the affected finger, and can provide relief from pain and inflammation within a few days. However, the relief may not last long, and multiple injections may be needed to maintain symptom relief.\nSteroids, on the other hand, work by reducing inflammation and swelling. They are also injected directly into the affected finger, and can provide longer-lasting relief from pain and inflammation compared to NSAIDs. However, steroids can have more side effects, such as weight gain, mood changes, and increased risk of infection.\nIn terms of efficacy, both NSAIDs and steroids have been shown to be effective in treating trigger finger. However, a study published in the Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons found that steroids may be more effective in providing long-term relief from symptoms.\nIt's important to note that the choice between NSAIDs and steroids will depend on the severity of the condition, the individual's medical history, and other factors. It's best to consult a healthcare professional to determine the most appropriate treatment option for each person.\nIn summary, both NSAIDs and steroids can be effective in treating trigger finger, but they have different mechanisms of action, efficacy, and potential side effects.

            "gold_answer": "Targeted therapies include a range of drugs that aim to modify specific conditions for growth and survival of cancer. In metastatic renal cancer, these treatments combined with immunotherapy provide better results than targeted therapy alone. Sunitinib versus avelumab plus axitinib Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that sunitinib alone is probably less effective for increasing progression\u2010free survival compared with the combination of avelumab plus axitinib (420 vs 550 per 1000 people survived; all results on average). Sunitinib alone also probably results in a lower response rate (257 vs 514 per 1000 people). However, there may be little to no difference between groups in overall survival or in serious adverse events (low\u2010certainty evidence). Reviewers found no data on health\u2010related quality of life. Sunitinib versus pembrolizumab plus axitinib Sunitinib alone is probably less effective for increasing progression\u2010free survival compared with the combination of pembrolizumab plus axitinib (465 vs 590 per 1000 people survived) at 12 months. Sunitinib alone is also probably less effective for increasing overall survival at 12 months (784 vs 880 per 1000 people survived) and for improving response rates (357 vs 593 per 1000 people) compared with combined treatment (moderate\u2010certainty evidence). However, low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that sunitinib alone may result in fewer adverse events (546 vs 604 per 1000 people), but differences between groups did not quite reach statistical significance. Reviewers found no data on health\u2010related quality of life. Sunitinib versus atezolizumab plus bevacizumab Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that sunitinib alone may be less effective for increasing progression\u2010free survival compared with the combination of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (421 vs 480 per 1000 people survived) at 12 months. Reviewers found few to no differences between groups in overall survival, response rate, and serious adverse events (moderate\u2010 to very low\u2010certainty evidence). Combined treatment may result in a slight improvement in quality of life compared with sunitinib alone (by about 1 point on a scale from 0 to 10).",

Targeted agents, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), can enhance the effectiveness of immunotherapy by blocking specific molecules that promote cancer growth and evasion of the immune system. Combining TKIs with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has shown promising results in clinical trials, with improved overall survival, response rates, and duration of response compared to ICI monotherapy. However, the optimal combination and sequence of therapies remains an area of ongoing research.",

            "gold_answer": "Targeted therapies include a range of drugs that aim to modify specific conditions for growth and survival of cancer. In metastatic renal cancer, these treatments combined with immunotherapy provide better results than targeted therapy alone. Sunitinib versus avelumab plus axitinib Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that sunitinib alone is probably less effective for increasing progression\u2010free survival compared with the combination of avelumab plus axitinib (420 vs 550 per 1000 people survived; all results on average). Sunitinib alone also probably results in a lower response rate (257 vs 514 per 1000 people). However, there may be little to no difference between groups in overall survival or in serious adverse events (low\u2010certainty evidence). Reviewers found no data on health\u2010related quality of life. Sunitinib versus pembrolizumab plus axitinib Sunitinib alone is probably less effective for increasing progression\u2010free survival compared with the combination of pembrolizumab plus axitinib (465 vs 590 per 1000 people survived) at 12 months. Sunitinib alone is also probably less effective for increasing overall survival at 12 months (784 vs 880 per 1000 people survived) and for improving response rates (357 vs 593 per 1000 people) compared with combined treatment (moderate\u2010certainty evidence). However, low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that sunitinib alone may result in fewer adverse events (546 vs 604 per 1000 people), but differences between groups did not quite reach statistical significance. Reviewers found no data on health\u2010related quality of life. Sunitinib versus atezolizumab plus bevacizumab Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that sunitinib alone may be less effective for increasing progression\u2010free survival compared with the combination of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (421 vs 480 per 1000 people survived) at 12 months. Reviewers found few to no differences between groups in overall survival, response rate, and serious adverse events (moderate\u2010 to very low\u2010certainty evidence). Combined treatment may result in a slight improvement in quality of life compared with sunitinib alone (by about 1 point on a scale from 0 to 10).",

Low\u2010certainty evidence yielded inconsistent results in terms of unplanned admission to hospital (6 to 24 months' follow\u2010up), patient health outcomes, patient satisfaction, and caregiver outcomes. No trial reported delays in care or the number of participants who died at their preferred location. It is worth noting that usual care varied considerably across studies (included home care but not specialized end\u2010of\u2010life care in two trials) and patients were diagnosed with cancer (47% to 100% across studies), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or heart failure.

Low\u2010certainty evidence yielded inconsistent results in terms of unplanned admission to hospital (6 to 24 months' follow\u2010up), patient health outcomes, patient satisfaction, and caregiver outcomes. No trial reported delays in care or the number of participants who died at their preferred location. It is worth noting that usual care varied considerably across studies (included home care but not specialized end\u2010of\u2010life care in two trials) and patients were diagnosed with cancer (47% to 100% across studies), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or heart failure. It is therefore difficult to conclude whether pooled results would apply to any particular intervention/population combination, or to people with other conditions.",

            "llm_answer": "Home-based end-of-life care can provide several benefits for terminally ill adults compared to usual care. These benefits may include:\n1. Improved quality of life: Patients receiving home-based care can receive personalized care in the comfort of their own home, which can lead to a better quality of life and improved symptom management.\n2. Increased patient satisfaction: By receiving care in their own home, patients can maintain their routine and surroundings, which can lead to higher patient satisfaction and a greater sense of control over their care.\n3. Better support for caregivers: Home-based care can provide additional support for caregivers, who can be overwhelmed by the responsibilities of caring for a loved one.\n4. Cost-effectiveness: Home-based care can be more cost-effective than institutional care, as it eliminates the need for hospitalization and can reduce the need for expensive medical equipment and infrastructure.\n5. Access to care: Home-based care can be particularly beneficial for patients living in rural or remote areas, where access to healthcare facilities may be limited.\n6. Personalized care: Home-based care allows for personalized care that is tailored to the individual's needs, values, and preferences.\n7. Emotional support: Home-based care can provide emotional support to patients and their families during a difficult time, which can help to alleviate anxiety, depression, and other mental health concerns.\n8. Better management of symptoms: Home-based care can provide better management of symptoms, such as pain, nausea, and breathing difficulties, which can improve the patient's overall quality of life.\n9. Increased access to palliative care: Home-based care can provide increased access to palliative care, which focuses on relieving symptoms, improving quality of life, and providing emotional and spiritual support to patients and their families.\nIt's important to note that home-based end-of-life care may not be suitable for all patients, and the decision to receive home-based care should be made on a case-by-case basis, in consultation with a healthcare professional.",

Although one RCT detected shorter length of hospital stay (by 1.5 days) in favor of cephalosporins versus broad\u2010spectrum penicillins, only 132 women were included; no RCTs have made the comparison with broad\u2010spectrum penicillins plus beta lactamase inhibitors.

This is because cephalosporins have a broader spectrum of activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including many strains of Streptococcus and Enterobacteriaceae that are commonly isolated from post-cesarean infections. Additionally, cephalosporins are less likely to induce bacterial resistance than penicillins, which can reduce their efficacy over time.

Although one RCT detected shorter length of hospital stay (by 1.5 days) in favor of cephalosporins versus broad\u2010spectrum penicillins, only 132 women were included; no RCTs have made the comparison with broad\u2010spectrum penicillins plus beta lactamase inhibitors.

Moderate\u2010quality evidence showed that this benefit was not sustained in the longer\u2010term (5 years). Low\u2010quality evidence suggests there was no benefit of an adjunctive corticosteroid in terms of reducing rates of disabling neurological deficit, ether within 24 months or at 5 years.

Moderate\u2010quality evidence showed that this benefit was not sustained in the longer\u2010term (5 years). Low\u2010quality evidence suggests there was no benefit of an adjunctive corticosteroid in terms of reducing rates of disabling neurological deficit, ether within 24 months or at 5 years. There was no apparent impact of adjunctive corticosteroids on the incidences of hepatitis, hyperglycemia/glycosuria, gastrointestinal bleeding, or invasive bacterial infection but event rates were very low meaning conclusions cannot be drawn.",

There is a lack of data on neonatal short\u2010term (early or late sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, neonatal death, hospital stay) and long\u2010term (major neurodevelopmental disability) potential benefits or harms following probiotic administration. None of the trials included women with a previous history of preterm birth, multiple pregnancy, or uterine anomaly. Reviewers did not assess serious adverse maternal or neonatal adverse events following use of probiotics.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "RCT (rct): A study which tests the effectiveness and safety of treatments or procedures as fairly and objectively as possible. By randomly assigning patients to different treatments for the same problem, the results can be assessed equally with the aim of discovering the best possible procedure for the condition.\nPLACEBO (placebo): an inactive substance; a pill/liquid that contains no medicine\nMORBIDITY (morbidity): undesired result or complication\nMORTALITY (mortality): death\nRISK (risk): The chance that an activity or hazard will give rise to harm. Risk is generally given in terms of numerical odds (1 in 10) or percentages (10%).\nSEPSIS (sepsis): The immune system's overreaction to an infection or injury which can lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and death.\nPOTENTIAL (potential): possible\nPOTENTIATE (potentiate): increase or multiply the effect of a drug or toxin (poison) by giving another drug or toxin at the same time (sometimes an unintentional result)\nPOTENTIATOR (potentiator): an agent that helps another agent work better\nASSESS (assess): to learn about, measure, evaluate, look at",

            "llm_answer": "Yes, probiotics administered to pregnant women have been shown to help prevent morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that can help maintain a healthy gut microbiome, which is important for the development and function of various bodily systems, including the immune system.\nStudies have found that probiotics can help reduce the risk of preterm birth, which is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Probiotics have also been shown to reduce the risk of other complications in preterm infants, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious condition that can cause damage to the intestines.\nIt's important to note that not all probiotics are the same, and some strains have been found to be more effective than others in preventing morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. For example, the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any supplements during pregnancy, including probiotics, to ensure safety and effectiveness. Additionally, it's important to note that while probiotics can help reduce the risk of complications, they are not a guarantee against them, and other factors such as proper prenatal care, a healthy diet, and a safe delivery are also important for a healthy pregnancy and baby.",
