Additionally, the study found that the use of follicular flushing was associated with a higher pregnancy rate (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.06-1.32) and a lower risk of failed fertilization (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.56-0.96) compared to aspiration alone.

In patients with CKD, excess aldosterone can contribute to the development of proteinuria (excess protein in the urine) and fibrosis (scarring) in the kidneys. RAS antagonists, such as ACE inhibitors or ARBs, are commonly used to treat hypertension and proteinuria in CKD patients. However, these medications may not fully address the underlying aldosterone excess.\nAldosterone antagonists, such as spironolactone or eplerenone, can help block the effects of aldosterone and reduce proteinuria. Some studies have shown that adding an aldosterone antagonist to a RAS antagonist can lead to greater reductions in proteinuria and slower progression of CKD compared to RAS antagonist therapy alone.\nHowever, it's important to note that the combination of RAS and aldosterone antagonists may also increase the risk of hyperkalemia (elevated potassium levels) and other side effects. Therefore, patients should be closely monitored for these complications and the combination should be used with caution.\nIn summary, adding an aldosterone antagonist to a RAS antagonist may be a useful strategy for slowing the progression of CKD with proteinuria, but it's important to carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks and closely monitor patients for side effects.",

Pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity were 95% and 99%, respectively, for both tests. Based on estimates to one decimal point, for every 1000 people tested at a prevalence of 10%, the average number of people wrongly diagnosed with rifampicin resistance would be 8 with Xpert Ultra and 11 with Xpert MTB/RIF, and the number of people with rifampicin resistance who are missed would be 5 with both tests. The probability of pulmonary TB would increase from 10% to 93% for Xpert Ultra and to 89% for Xpert MTB/RIF after a positive test and would decrease to 0.6% after a negative test for both tests.",

While both tests have been shown to have high sensitivity and specificity for MTB detection, their performance for rifampicin resistance detection may vary.\nA systematic review and meta-analysis published in 2020 compared the accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra for rifampicin resistance detection in adults with presumptive pulmonary TB. The review included 19 studies that reported on the performance of both tests in detecting rifampicin resistance, with a total of 2,335 participants.\nThe results showed that Xpert Ultra had a higher sensitivity than Xpert MTB/RIF for detecting rifampicin resistance (88.9% vs 78.4%, respectively), while specificity was similar between the two tests (96.4% vs 95.5%). The positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were also higher for Xpert Ultra than for Xpert MTB/RIF (93.5% vs 83.1% and 90.2% vs 85.1%, respectively).\nOverall, the evidence suggests that Xpert Ultra may have a slight advantage over Xpert MTB/RIF in terms of accuracy for detecting rifampicin resistance in adults with presumptive pulmonary TB. However, both tests have high sensitivity and specificity, and the choice between them may depend on factors such as availability, cost, and clinical context.",

Pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity were 95% and 99%, respectively, for both tests. Based on estimates to one decimal point, for every 1000 people tested at a prevalence of 10%, the average number of people wrongly diagnosed with rifampicin resistance would be 8 with Xpert Ultra and 11 with Xpert MTB/RIF, and the number of people with rifampicin resistance who are missed would be 5 with both tests. The probability of pulmonary TB would increase from 10% to 93% for Xpert Ultra and to 89% for Xpert MTB/RIF after a positive test and would decrease to 0.6% after a negative test for both tests.",

Treatment for GERD, such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or H2-blockers, can help reduce asthma symptoms by reducing the amount of stomach acid that flows back up into the esophagus. Studies have shown that treating GERD can improve asthma symptoms, lung function, and quality of life in adults with asthma.\nFor children with asthma, GERD can also worsen asthma symptoms, and treating GERD can improve asthma outcomes. However, the effects of GERD treatment on asthma in children are less well-studied than in adults. A study published in the Journal of Pediatrics found that children with asthma who received treatment for GERD had improved lung function and reduced asthma symptoms compared to those who did not receive GERD treatment.\nIt's important to note that not all children with asthma have GERD, and not all children with GERD have asthma. If your child has asthma and you suspect they may have GERD, it's important to consult with their pediatrician to determine the best course of treatment.\nIn summary, pharmacological interventions for GERD can improve asthma symptoms and quality of life in adults and children with asthma, but the effects may vary depending on the individual.

            "gold_answer": "In subfertile men aged 18 to 65 years old, antioxidants (either single or combined) seem to improve reproductive outcomes. However, the evidence is of low to very low certainty, which precludes any firm conclusions. Low\u2010 to very low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that live birth (12 RCTs with 1283 participants) and clinical pregnancy rates (20 RCTs with 1706 participants) are higher with antioxidant therapy (on average, 235 vs 177 per 1000 men and 174 vs 100 per 1000 men, respectively) than with placebo or no treatment, irrespective of whether couples were undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF)/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) or not. Total sperm motility (25 RCTs with 1638 participants) seems to improve in the short, medium, and longer term with antioxidant therapy. Evidence for sperm DNA fragmentation was underpowered to permit any conclusions. Very low\u2010certainty evidence suggests there may be slightly more gastrointestinal adverse events with antioxidants, but no apparent effects on miscarriage, stillbirth, euphoria, headache, upper respiratory infection, nasopharyngitis, and ectopic pregnancy rates; however, event rates were low.",

By randomly assigning patients to different treatments for the same problem, the results can be assessed equally with the aim of discovering the best possible procedure for the condition.\nCLINICAL (clinical): pertaining to medical care\nPLACEBO (placebo): an inactive substance; a pill/liquid that contains no medicine\nFERTILITY (fertility): The ability to conceive a baby and, for a woman, to become pregnant.\nIVF (ivf): A technique where eggs are collected from a woman and fertilised with a man\u2019s sperm outside the body. Usually one or two embryos are then transferred to the womb. If one or more of them implants successfully, the woman becomes pregnant.\nSPERM (sperm): The male reproductive cell which fertilises a woman\u2019s eggs. Men usually have millions of sperm in their semen.\nICSI (icsi): A form of assisted conception in which a single sperm is injected into an egg.\nMOTILITY (motility): the ability to move\nTERM (term): Between 37 and 42 weeks of pregnancy.\nGASTROINTESTINAL (gastrointestinal): Relating to the stomach and intestine.\nMISCARRIAGE (miscarriage): The unplanned ending of a pregnancy before 23 completed weeks.\nSTILLBIRTH (stillbirth): When a baby is born dead after the 23rd completed week of pregnancy.",

            "llm_answer": "Antioxidants have been found to have various effects on male subfertility, including:\n1. Improving sperm quality: Antioxidants can help protect sperm from oxidative stress, which can damage sperm DNA and membranes, leading to increased sperm motility and morphology.\n2. Enhancing testosterone levels: Some antioxidants, such as vitamin D and zinc, have been shown to increase testosterone levels, which can improve sperm quality and fertility.\n3. Reducing inflammation: Antioxidants can help reduce inflammation in the reproductive tract, which can improve sperm quality and reduce the risk of infertility.\n4. Protecting against DNA damage: Antioxidants can help protect sperm DNA from damage caused by free radicals, which can increase the risk of infertility and birth defects.\n5. Improving semen quality: Antioxidants can help improve semen quality by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation in the seminal fluid.\nIt's important to note that while antioxidants may have beneficial effects on male fertility, they should not be used as a replacement for medical treatment for infertility.

            "gold_answer": "In subfertile men aged 18 to 65 years old, antioxidants (either single or combined) seem to improve reproductive outcomes. However, the evidence is of low to very low certainty, which precludes any firm conclusions. Low\u2010 to very low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that live birth (12 RCTs with 1283 participants) and clinical pregnancy rates (20 RCTs with 1706 participants) are higher with antioxidant therapy (on average, 235 vs 177 per 1000 men and 174 vs 100 per 1000 men, respectively) than with placebo or no treatment, irrespective of whether couples were undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF)/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) or not. Total sperm motility (25 RCTs with 1638 participants) seems to improve in the short, medium, and longer term with antioxidant therapy. Evidence for sperm DNA fragmentation was underpowered to permit any conclusions. Very low\u2010certainty evidence suggests there may be slightly more gastrointestinal adverse events with antioxidants, but no apparent effects on miscarriage, stillbirth, euphoria, headache, upper respiratory infection, nasopharyngitis, and ectopic pregnancy rates; however, event rates were low.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "SUBFERTILITY (subfertility): When a couple fail to conceive after having regular sexual intercourse for more than a year. \u2018Regular\u2019 is defined as two or three times a week.\nRCT (rct): A study which tests the effectiveness and safety of treatments or procedures as fairly and objectively as possible. By randomly assigning patients to different treatments for the same problem, the results can be assessed equally with the aim of discovering the best possible procedure for the condition.\nCLINICAL (clinical): pertaining to medical care\nPLACEBO (placebo): an inactive substance; a pill/liquid that contains no medicine\nFERTILITY (fertility): The ability to conceive a baby and, for a woman, to become pregnant.\nIVF (ivf): A technique where eggs are collected from a woman and fertilised with a man\u2019s sperm outside the body. Usually one or two embryos are then transferred to the womb. If one or more of them implants successfully, the woman becomes pregnant.\nSPERM (sperm): The male reproductive cell which fertilises a woman\u2019s eggs. Men usually have millions of sperm in their semen.\nICSI (icsi): A form of assisted conception in which a single sperm is injected into an egg.\nMOTILITY (motility): the ability to move\nTERM (term): Between 37 and 42 weeks of pregnancy.\nGASTROINTESTINAL (gastrointestinal): Relating to the stomach and intestine.\nMISCARRIAGE (miscarriage): The unplanned ending of a pregnancy before 23 completed weeks.\nSTILLBIRTH (stillbirth): When a baby is born dead after the 23rd completed week of pregnancy.",

            "llm_answer": "Antioxidants have been found to have positive effects on male subfertility. Oxidative stress, which results from an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the body's ability to detoxify these harmful compounds, can damage sperm cells and contribute to male infertility. Antioxidants help to neutralize ROS and reduce oxidative stress, which can improve sperm quality and increase the chances of successful fertilization.\nSome studies have shown that antioxidants such as vitamin C, vitamin E, and zinc can improve sperm motility, morphology, and concentration. Additionally, antioxidants may also help to reduce inflammation and improve the overall health of the reproductive system.\nHowever, it's important to note that while antioxidants may have beneficial effects on male subfertility, they should not be used as a replacement for medical treatment.

Low\u2010certainty evidence also suggests benefit of tocilizumab for mortality at 28 to 90 days when time to event is incorporated into the analysis (on average, 24 vs 37 per 1000 people; median survival times not reported). Results for adverse events and serious adverse events were imprecise. Less evidence is available for sarilumab (200 mg or 400 mg); reviewers rated most evidence as low certainty, and data for some clinically important outcomes are absent.",

Low\u2010certainty evidence also suggests benefit of tocilizumab for mortality at 28 to 90 days when time to event is incorporated into the analysis (on average, 24 vs 37 per 1000 people; median survival times not reported). Results for adverse events and serious adverse events were imprecise. Less evidence is available for sarilumab (200 mg or 400 mg); reviewers rated most evidence as low certainty, and data for some clinically important outcomes are absent.",

            "llm_answer": "Tocilizumab and sarilumab are interleukin-6 (IL-6) blocking agents that have been used to treat severe COVID-19 in adults. These drugs work by blocking the action of IL-6, a protein that is involved in the immune response and can cause inflammation in the body.\nStudies have shown that tocilizumab and sarilumab can help reduce the severity of COVID-19 symptoms and improve survival rates in adults with severe COVID-19. They have been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, and death.\nHowever, it's important to note that these drugs can have side effects, including an increased risk of infections and gastrointestinal bleeding. Additionally, the long-term effects of using these drugs are not yet fully understood, and more research is needed to determine their safety and efficacy in the long term.\nIt's also important to note that not all adults with COVID-19 will benefit from these drugs, and their use should be carefully evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Patients with mild or moderate COVID-19 may not require these drugs, and treatment should be based on the severity of their symptoms and other individual factors.\nIn summary, tocilizumab and sarilumab can be effective in treating severe COVID-19 in adults, but their use should be carefully evaluated and monitored due to potential side effects and limited long-term data.",

            "gold_answer": "Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that for adults with mild COVID\u201019, fluvoxamine may slightly reduce all\u2010cause mortality at day 28 (23 vs 33 per 1000 people, all results on average) and may reduce admission to hospital or death (a composite outcome; 73 vs 131 per 1000 people) when compared with placebo. However, the 95% confidence interval is compatible with important beneficial and harmful effects, and results did not reach statistical significance. The evidence for the effects of fluvoxamine on serious and any grade adverse events is very uncertain, and no study reported quality of life or suicide attempt. Numerical data on symptom resolution were not available.",

            "gold_answer": "Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that for adults with mild COVID\u201019, fluvoxamine may slightly reduce all\u2010cause mortality at day 28 (23 vs 33 per 1000 people, all results on average) and may reduce admission to hospital or death (a composite outcome; 73 vs 131 per 1000 people) when compared with placebo. However, the 95% confidence interval is compatible with important beneficial and harmful effects, and results did not reach statistical significance. The evidence for the effects of fluvoxamine on serious and any grade adverse events is very uncertain, and no study reported quality of life or suicide attempt. Numerical data on symptom resolution were not available.",

However, it's important to note that the use of fluvoxamine for this purpose is still experimental and has not been widely studied.\nPotential benefits of using fluvoxamine for adults with mild COVID-19 include:\n* Reduced severity of symptoms: Some studies have suggested that fluvoxamine may help reduce the severity of COVID-19 symptoms, such as fever, cough, and shortness of breath, in adults with mild cases of the virus.\n* Improved mental health: Fluvoxamine is an antidepressant, and it may help improve mood and reduce anxiety and depression in individuals with mild COVID-19 who are experiencing psychological distress.\nHowever, there are also potential harms associated with using fluvoxamine for adults with mild COVID-19, including:\n* Side effects: Like all medications, fluvoxamine can cause side effects, such as nausea, dizziness, and sleep disturbances. These side effects can be uncomfortable and may affect an individual's quality of life.\n* Interactions with other medications: Fluvoxamine may interact with other medications an individual is taking, which can cause harmful side effects or reduce the effectiveness of the medications.\n* Unknown long-term effects: The long-term effects of using fluvoxamine to treat mild COVID-19 are not yet fully understood, and it's possible that there may be unintended consequences of using this medication for this purpose.\nIt's important to note that the use of fluvoxamine for mild COVID-19 is still experimental and has not been widely studied. As with any medication, it's important to discuss the potential benefits and harms with a healthcare professional before starting treatment. Additionally, it's important to follow the guidance of public health officials and medical professionals regarding the best treatment options for COVID-19.",

            "gold_answer": "Malaria rapid diagnostic tests (mRDT) may improve some outcomes in diagnosing and treating malaria in the community. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that probably fewer people who were microscopy/polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\u2010negative were prescribed antimalarials when mRDT were used compared with clinical diagnosis (15 vs 85 per 1000 people; all results on average). High\u2010certainty evidence shows that more people received \u2018appropriate treatment\u2019 (i.e. antimalarials in people with malaria and no antimalarials in people without malaria) with mRDT than with clinical diagnosis (67 vs 22 per 1000 people). Overall, fewer people with mRDT received antimalarials (20 vs 96 per 1000 people; low\u2010certainty evidence), but more who were microscopy/PCR\u2010negative received antibiotics (25 vs 12 per 1000 people; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Regarding mortality, overall three deaths were reported in the mRDT group, and one in the clinical diagnosis group (very low\u2010certainty evidence). Two cases of severe malaria and malaria\u2010specific mortality were reported by a single RCT with around 3000 participants, but it was not reported to which study group they belonged. The same RCT reported that 1.1% of participants developed drug\u2010related adverse events, but again, this information was not reported per group.",

            "url": "https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cca/doi/10.1002/cca.4204",
            "llm_answer": "Malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are generally more accurate than clinical diagnosis for diagnosing malaria in both adults and children in the community. RDTs can detect the presence of malaria parasites in a patient's blood within 15-30 minutes, whereas clinical diagnosis relies on symptoms and physical examination, which can be nonspecific and may not always accurately identify malaria. A systematic review and meta-analysis published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews found that RDTs had a sensitivity of 83.4% and a specificity of 94.6% for detecting malaria infection, compared to clinical diagnosis which had a sensitivity of 68.3% and a specificity of 89.4%. Additionally, RDTs can help reduce overtreatment with antimalarial drugs, as they can distinguish between malaria and other causes of fever. However, it's important to note that RDTs are not perfect and false negatives can occur, particularly in low-parasitemia infections. Therefore, it's important to use RDTs in combination with clinical judgment and other diagnostic tests, such as microscopy, to ensure accurate diagnosis and treatment of malaria.",

            "gold_answer": "Malaria rapid diagnostic tests (mRDT) may improve some outcomes in diagnosing and treating malaria in the community. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that probably fewer people who were microscopy/polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\u2010negative were prescribed antimalarials when mRDT were used compared with clinical diagnosis (15 vs 85 per 1000 people; all results on average). High\u2010certainty evidence shows that more people received \u2018appropriate treatment\u2019 (i.e. antimalarials in people with malaria and no antimalarials in people without malaria) with mRDT than with clinical diagnosis (67 vs 22 per 1000 people). Overall, fewer people with mRDT received antimalarials (20 vs 96 per 1000 people; low\u2010certainty evidence), but more who were microscopy/PCR\u2010negative received antibiotics (25 vs 12 per 1000 people; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Regarding mortality, overall three deaths were reported in the mRDT group, and one in the clinical diagnosis group (very low\u2010certainty evidence). Two cases of severe malaria and malaria\u2010specific mortality were reported by a single RCT with around 3000 participants, but it was not reported to which study group they belonged. The same RCT reported that 1.1% of participants developed drug\u2010related adverse events, but again, this information was not reported per group.",

            "llm_answer": "Malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and clinical diagnosis are both important tools for diagnosing and treating malaria in adults and children in the community. However, they have some differences in terms of accuracy, speed, and ease of use.\nClinical diagnosis, which is based on symptoms and physical examination, can be less accurate than RDTs, especially in areas where malaria is less common. Studies have shown that clinical diagnosis can miss up to 70% of malaria cases, particularly in low-transmission settings.\nRDTs, on the other hand, are rapid and simple to use, and can detect malaria infection in a matter of minutes. They are also more accurate than clinical diagnosis, with sensitivity ranging from 80-95% and specificity ranging from 90-100%. RDTs can also distinguish between different species of Plasmodium parasites, which is important for guiding treatment.\nHowever, RDTs are not perfect and may not always detect very low levels of parasitemia. In addition, they may not be able to distinguish between active and past infections, which can lead to over-diagnosis and over-treatment.\nIn summary, while both clinical diagnosis and RDTs have their advantages and limitations, RDTs are generally more accurate and rapid, and are recommended as the first line of diagnosis for malaria in adults and children in the community. However, it is important to use RDTs in conjunction with clinical evaluation and other diagnostic tests, such as microscopy, to ensure accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.",

            "gold_answer": "In adults with nephrotic syndrome and idiopathic membranous nephropathy, moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that immunosuppression (using adrenocorticotropic hormone, chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, ciclosporin, mizoribine, mycophenolate mofetil, rituximab, steroids, or tacrolimus) probably results in fewer people developing end\u2010stage kidney disease (64 vs 108 per 1000 people; all results on average) and in more people having complete or partial remission than with no immunosuppression (497 vs 345 per 1000 people). Fewer people probably experienced a 100% increase in serum creatinine with immunosuppression (133 vs 289 per 1000 people). However, moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that more people likely had temporary or permanent discontinuation of treatment or hospitalization due to adverse events with immunosuppression, although the numbers in both groups were very low (13 vs 2 per 1000 people). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that more people may relapse after complete or partial remission with immunosuppression than with control (456 vs 263 per 1000 people). Results on infection and malignancy were very uncertain.",

            "llm_answer": "Immunosuppressive treatments for adults with idiopathic membranous nephropathy (IMN) and nephrotic syndrome can have several effects, including:\n1. Reduced proteinuria: Immunosuppressive drugs, such as corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, and cyclosporine, can help reduce proteinuria and alleviate nephrotic syndrome symptoms.\n2. Improved kidney function: Immunosuppressive treatments can help stabilize or improve kidney function, as measured by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\n3. Reduced risk of kidney failure: By reducing proteinuria and improving kidney function, immunosuppressive treatments can lower the risk of kidney failure and the need for dialysis or kidney transplantation.\n4. Increased risk of infections: Immunosuppressive drugs can weaken the immune system, increasing the risk of infections, such as pneumonia, bronchitis, and urinary tract infections.\n5. Increased risk of cancer: Long-term use of immunosuppressive drugs, particularly cyclophosphamide, may increase the risk of certain types of cancer, such as lymphoma.\n6. Side effects: Immunosuppressive drugs can have various side effects, including nausea, vomiting, hair loss, and an increased risk of kidney damage.\n7. Monitoring requirements: Patients receiving immunosuppressive treatments require regular monitoring of blood cell counts, kidney function, and blood pressure to minimize the risk of adverse effects.\n8. Cost and accessibility: Immunosuppressive treatments can be expensive, and accessibility may be limited in some countries or regions.\n9. Potential for remission: In some cases, immunosuppressive treatments may lead to remission of IMN, but the likelihood of remission varies depending on individual patient factors.\n10.

            "gold_answer": "In adults with nephrotic syndrome and idiopathic membranous nephropathy, moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that immunosuppression (using adrenocorticotropic hormone, chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, ciclosporin, mizoribine, mycophenolate mofetil, rituximab, steroids, or tacrolimus) probably results in fewer people developing end\u2010stage kidney disease (64 vs 108 per 1000 people; all results on average) and in more people having complete or partial remission than with no immunosuppression (497 vs 345 per 1000 people). Fewer people probably experienced a 100% increase in serum creatinine with immunosuppression (133 vs 289 per 1000 people). However, moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that more people likely had temporary or permanent discontinuation of treatment or hospitalization due to adverse events with immunosuppression, although the numbers in both groups were very low (13 vs 2 per 1000 people). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that more people may relapse after complete or partial remission with immunosuppression than with control (456 vs 263 per 1000 people). Results on infection and malignancy were very uncertain.",

            "llm_answer": "Immunosuppressive treatments for adults with idiopathic membranous nephropathy (IMN) and nephrotic syndrome can have several effects, including:\n1. Reduced proteinuria: Immunosuppressive drugs, such as corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, and cyclosporine, can help reduce the amount of protein in the urine, which is a hallmark symptom of nephrotic syndrome.\n2. Improved kidney function: By reducing inflammation and immune activity, immunosuppressive treatments can help slow the progression of kidney damage and improve kidney function.\n3. Reduced risk of complications: Immunosuppressive treatments can help reduce the risk of complications associated with nephrotic syndrome, such as edema, hyperlipidemia, and thrombotic events.\n4. Increased risk of infections: Immunosuppressive drugs can suppress the immune system, increasing the risk of infections, such as urinary tract infections, pneumonia, and sepsis.\n5. Increased risk of malignancies: Long-term use of immunosuppressive drugs can increase the risk of developing certain types of cancer, such as skin cancer, lymphoma, and kidney cancer.\n6. Side effects: Immunosuppressive drugs can have various side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hair loss, and fatigue.\nIt's important to note that the effects of immunosuppressive treatments for IMN and nephrotic syndrome can vary depending on the individual patient and the specific treatment regimen used. It's important to work closely with a healthcare provider to monitor for potential side effects and to adjust the treatment plan as needed. Additionally, it's important to note that immunosuppressive treatments are not always effective for all patients with IMN and nephrotic syndrome, and other treatments, such as plasmapheresis or rituximab, may be considered in certain cases.",

Moderate\u2010quality evidence showed that this benefit was not sustained in the longer\u2010term (5 years). Low\u2010quality evidence suggests there was no benefit of an adjunctive corticosteroid in terms of reducing rates of disabling neurological deficit, ether within 24 months or at 5 years. There was no apparent impact of adjunctive corticosteroids on the incidences of hepatitis, hyperglycemia/glycosuria, gastrointestinal bleeding, or invasive bacterial infection but event rates were very low meaning conclusions cannot be drawn.",

Studies have consistently demonstrated that corticosteroids reduce the risk of death and disability in patients with tuberculous meningitis, particularly in those with severe disease. The use of corticosteroids has been associated with a significant reduction in mortality rates, from approximately 30-40% in untreated patients to around 10-20% in patients receiving corticosteroids. Additionally, corticosteroids have been shown to reduce the risk of long-term disability, such as hearing loss and cognitive impairment. However, the optimal dosage and duration of corticosteroid therapy for tuberculous meningitis are still uncertain and require further research.",

Moderate\u2010quality evidence showed that this benefit was not sustained in the longer\u2010term (5 years). Low\u2010quality evidence suggests there was no benefit of an adjunctive corticosteroid in terms of reducing rates of disabling neurological deficit, ether within 24 months or at 5 years. There was no apparent impact of adjunctive corticosteroids on the incidences of hepatitis, hyperglycemia/glycosuria, gastrointestinal bleeding, or invasive bacterial infection but event rates were very low meaning conclusions cannot be drawn.",

Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that in pregnant women who received probiotics, the risk of preterm birth (< 37 weeks) and miscarriage/stillbirth was no more or less likely compared with those who did not receive probiotics. Only one RCT (159 infants) reported no incidences of early neonatal sepsis (\u2264 3 days) in either trial arm. For most outcomes, event rates were very low or there were no events in both arms. There is a lack of data on neonatal short\u2010term (early or late sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, neonatal death, hospital stay) and long\u2010term (major neurodevelopmental disability) potential benefits or harms following probiotic administration.

            "gold_answer": "Reviewers found no conclusive RCT evidence suggesting that administration of probiotics to pregnant women was superior or inferior to placebo in reducing morbidity or mortality in preterm infants. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that in pregnant women who received probiotics, the risk of preterm birth (< 37 weeks) and miscarriage/stillbirth was no more or less likely compared with those who did not receive probiotics. Only one RCT (159 infants) reported no incidences of early neonatal sepsis (\u2264 3 days) in either trial arm. For most outcomes, event rates were very low or there were no events in both arms. There is a lack of data on neonatal short\u2010term (early or late sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, neonatal death, hospital stay) and long\u2010term (major neurodevelopmental disability) potential benefits or harms following probiotic administration. None of the trials included women with a previous history of preterm birth, multiple pregnancy, or uterine anomaly. Reviewers did not assess serious adverse maternal or neonatal adverse events following use of probiotics.",
            "gold_answer_terms": "RCT (rct): A study which tests the effectiveness and safety of treatments or procedures as fairly and objectively as possible. By randomly assigning patients to different treatments for the same problem, the results can be assessed equally with the aim of discovering the best possible procedure for the condition.\nPLACEBO (placebo): an inactive substance; a pill/liquid that contains no medicine\nMORBIDITY (morbidity): undesired result or complication\nMORTALITY (mortality): death\nRISK (risk): The chance that an activity or hazard will give rise to harm. Risk is generally given in terms of numerical odds (1 in 10) or percentages (10%).\nSEPSIS (sepsis): The immune system's overreaction to an infection or injury which can lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and death.\nPOTENTIAL (potential): possible\nPOTENTIATE (potentiate): increase or multiply the effect of a drug or toxin (poison) by giving another drug or toxin at the same time (sometimes an unintentional result)\nPOTENTIATOR (potentiator): an agent that helps another agent work better\nASSESS (assess): to learn about, measure, evaluate, look at",

            "llm_answer": "Yes, probiotics administered to pregnant women have been shown to help prevent morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that can help maintain a healthy gut microbiome, which is important for the development and function of various bodily systems, including the immune system.\nStudies have found that probiotics can help reduce the risk of preterm birth, which is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Probiotics have also been shown to reduce the risk of other complications in preterm infants, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious condition that can cause damage to the intestines.\nIt's important to note that not all probiotics are the same, and some strains have been found to be more effective than others in preventing morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. For example, the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any supplements during pregnancy, including probiotics, to ensure safety and effectiveness. Additionally, it's important to note that while probiotics can help reduce the risk of complications, they are not a guarantee against them, and other factors such as proper prenatal care, a healthy diet, and a safe delivery are also important for a healthy pregnancy and baby.",
